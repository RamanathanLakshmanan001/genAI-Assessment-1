*   **Currently (post-spinoff):** The focus is on three separate companies, each with its own direction:

    *   **GE Aerospace:** ""to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely.""
    *   **GE Vernova:** ""Building on over 130 years of experience, leading a new era of energy.""
    *   **GE HealthCare:** ""Every patient has a story to tell"" (implying patient-centric care).

Therefore, while a traditional mission statement isn't prominently displayed, their values revolve around innovation, progress, improving lives (through aerospace, energy, and healthcare), and a legacy of building a better future.","Based on the provided context, GE (General Electric) has been restructured into three standalone public companies:

*   **GE Aerospace:** Focuses on the future of flight.
*   **GE Vernova:** Focuses on energy transition across wind, gas, the grid, and more.
*   **GE HealthCare:** Focuses on healthcare solutions.

*   Holiday lighting and decor
*   Home electrical products

*   **Founding Year:** The ""About Us"" page mentions ""Since 1892"" in the context of imagining a bolder, brighter tomorrow and vowing to build a world that works, for everyone. This suggests 1892 is the founding year of the original GE.
