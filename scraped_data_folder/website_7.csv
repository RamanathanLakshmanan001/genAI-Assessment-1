Our reporting strategy
Our sustainability journey
PepsiCo Positive
Our vision is to Be the Global Leader in Convenient Foods and Drinks by Winning with PepsiCo Positive (pep+). pep+ is our strategic end-to-end transformation that places sustainability at the center of how we will create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people.
pep+ seeks to continue to transform the way we do business, inspiring our partners, peers and employees along the way to work together to advance positive change.

We strongly believe that the long-term success of our company is intrinsically linked to a healthy planet, resilient food systems and the holistic well-being of our people and the communities we serve. That’s why we invest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) programs, which we believe will help future-proof and strengthen our business for the long-term.

Since introducing our pep+ strategy in 2021, we’ve achieved a few of our goals ahead of schedule — including our 2025 operational water-use efficiency goal — and made meaningful progress on others. Still, there are areas of our pep+ agenda, like climate and packaging, where we continue striving to advance our work. These areas require systemic changes, collective actions and industry-wide investment to achieve broader progress in addition to our own efforts. We regularly review our pep+ goals and consider whether any changes to our goals are warranted. This ESG Summary communicates the work we’re doing throughout PepsiCo as we work toward achieving our pep+ goals.

1. As of December 30, 2023.
We are very clear that pep+ is the future of our company, and we are focused on three interconnected pillars with bold goals:
Positive Agriculture
We are working to source our crops and ingredients in ways that restore the earth and strengthen farming communities.
Learn more
Positive Value Chain
We are helping to build a circular and inclusive value chain.
Learn more
Positive Choices
We are inspiring people through our brands to make choices that create more smiles for them and the planet.
Learn more
Our complex value chain 
We aspire to help address global challenges such as the impacts of climate change, social inequality and lack of access to nutritious food.
More than 35 agricultural crops and ingredients are grown around the world before they are made into beloved PepsiCo products at more than 1,000 manufacturing facilities, including more than 290 company-owned facilities.

Our products are then packaged and moved by gas-, biofuel- and electric-powered vehicles across approximately 1.2 billion miles worldwide by our company-owned fleet (and even more through third-party transportation providers) to be sold and enjoyed by our consumers more than one billion times a day.

Once enjoyed, the packaging from our products should be collected and recycled where possible for another use to create a more circular economy.
Agricultural Sourcing PepsiCo sources crops and ingredients from farmers in more than 60 countries. The outcomes and standards we promote can help improve the environmental, social and economic resilience of agricultural communities around the world.
Consumption PepsiCo products are enjoyed by consumers more than one billion times a day. We are responding to changing consumer preferences by refreshing much of our product portfolio and reformulating many of our convenient foods and drinks to incorporate more diverse ingredients and reduce added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.
Distribution PepsiCo products are sold in over 200 countries and territories. In 2023, our company-owned fleet traveled approximately 1.2 billion miles worldwide — and even more than that through third-party transportation providers — to bring PepsiCo products to customers. We are working to continue to address the environmental impact of our fleet by adopting more efficient vehicles and practices, and we are developing and sharing best practices with third-party transportation providers to encourage them to do the same.
R&D and Manufacturing We spent more than $800 million on R&D in 2023 as part of our continued investment in developing quality and innovative convenient foods and drinks. Our more than 290 company-owned manufacturing facilities bring together innovators and operations teams who strive to use water, energy and product ingredients more efficiently.
Post-Consumer PepsiCo’s sustainable packaging vision is to help build a world where packaging never becomes waste. We continue to focus on the amount of packaging we use, expand our portfolio of reuse offerings, innovate sustainable packaging and work to improve recycling infrastructure.
Governance
We believe that strong governance is the foundation for delivering on our pep+ agenda. Our ESG approach is integrated into — not separate from — our business.
Our corporate governance reflects this approach, with an integrated structure that combines Board and senior leadership oversight with subject-matter and localized expertise that informs our strategy and how we execute it.

The full Board considers sustainability issues to be an integral part of its business strategy oversight. Throughout the year, the Board and the relevant committees receive updates from and discuss with management sustainability, human capital management (including diversity, equity and inclusion) and public policy matters, including the company’s key programs, related goals and progress toward achieving these goals.

To assist the Board in its oversight and to align it with our sustainability agenda, the Board established the Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee (the Committee) in 2017. The Committee assists the Board in providing more focused oversight over the company’s policies and programs and related risks that concern key sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion and public policy matters. The Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors and currently reflects a mix of public policy, risk, international and science-related skills, qualifications and experience.

At the executive level, our ESG strategy and progress toward our pep+ goals are also regularly reviewed by the Sustainability sub-committee of our Executive Committee. This sub-committee is composed of members of our senior leadership management team and provides opportunities for our senior leadership to align on major strategic issues relating to sustainability and keep sustainability in focus among competing priorities.

Our reporting strategy
Reporting is one of the primary ways we inform key stakeholders about our ESG ambitions and progress. Our stakeholders include investors, potential and current employees, customers and consumers, suppliers, the communities where we live and work, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), regulators and others.
Understanding that each group’s needs differ, we publish a suite of reporting elements targeted at various sets of stakeholders. We combine disclosure of strategy, policy, data2 and case studies according to our understanding of public interest and guided by key sustainability and reporting frameworks.
Our reporting suite consists of the following:
ESG Summary: A high-level overview of our pep+ agenda and annual progress. It aims to reflect the integration between ESG and our business and is designed to link seamlessly with our ESG Topics A-Z for more detail and the latest updates. Readers can also download a PDF of the report.
ESG Topics A-Z: An evergreen, encyclopedia-style deep-dive on more than 50 sustainability-related topics designed to provide accessible, consistent information for those looking for greater depth on PepsiCo’s ESG strategy, management, policies, progress and partnerships.
ESG Performance Metrics: Time-series data3 for our key sustainability goals4, intended to support ESG analysis primarily for investors, ESG raters and NGOs.
Indices and framework responses and other topic-specific disclosures: These map our reporting to specific metrics established by voluntary reporting frameworks including Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) climate, water and forest responses. It also includes specialized reporting, such as our annual Green Bond, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) and the PepsiCo Foundation’s Global Impact reports.
2. As a general matter, recent organizational changes (e.g., acquisitions and divestitures) are reflected in our reporting as soon as practical. Unless otherwise noted, goals and progress reflect the impact of our acquisitions of Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. (Be & Cheery), Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (Pioneer Foods), and SodaStream International Ltd. and our divestiture of Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands (Tropicana). Organizational changes (e.g., acquisitions, mergers, and divestitures) are evaluated to determine if they have a significant impact on our sustainability performance and, as data becomes available, all reported years for metrics impacted by an organizational change are recast to consistently reflect the impact of the organizational change. Targets apply to PepsiCo’s operations as well as our value chain (e.g., franchise bottlers, joint ventures where PepsiCo has operational control, co-manufacturers, etc.) unless otherwise noted
3. For 2023 reporting, we've reduced our time-series data from five years to three years to better align with the number of years in evolving regulatory and voluntary frameworks
4. For detail on how we measure performance against these goals, see Calculation methodology on ESG Topics A-Z
Our sustainability journey
For nearly two decades, PepsiCo has been on a journey to transform the way we do business so that our pursuit to deliver strong financial returns is also responsive to the needs of our stakeholders and the world around us.

We're making a difference through
the PepsiCo Foundation
The PepsiCo Foundation: We feed potential
At the heart of the PepsiCo Foundation is our belief in the potential possessed by the people and communities we serve. There are far too many communities around the world, however, that are systemically excluded from access to the essential resources they need to grow, prosper and thrive — like nutritious food, safe water and economic opportunity. That is why the PepsiCo Foundation’s work focuses on the creation of sustainable and innovative solutions to these three critical socioeconomic issues. We know that by alleviating the stress and strain of these barriers, we come one step closer to creating a more equitable world for all.
We are honored to be able to step up to the plate and be a beacon of hope to the millions of people and communities around the world. For more information on how we're positively impacting the planet and the communities where we live and work while progressing towards our pep+ goals, download our 2023 Global Impact Report.

What we're focused on
We’ve been investing in tangible social impact since 1962.
Collaborating with industry peers, local and international organizations, nonprofits, and our employees around the globe, we are on a mission to build a more sustainable food system and equitable world through the power of community. Listening to, learning from and being led by the communities we serve is the only way we can take on the biggest challenges facing our global society.
Though our reach is global, we understand that it takes the collaborative efforts of many to make real change in the local communities where we operate. We realize we can do even more when we join forces with industry peers, local and international organizations, and our employees to make large-scale change.
Food security
Communities flourish when they’re getting the nutritious food they need. Children are better educated; economies grow; and people live healthier, longer lives.

Safe water
Access to safe water is a human right. This precious resource is critical to human dignity, health and economic opportunity.

Economic opportunity
As needs intensify globally and families are faced with increased uncertainty, our Foundation is investing to provide underserved populations with the support they need to manage through these unpredictable times and build capability for a more stable future.

Changemakers Mexico: Banco de Alimentos Cáritas Puebla
Araceli sacrificed her own health to care for her child with special needs. She never thought she would be able to treat her degenerative eye disease due to the costs. But with support from the PepsiCo Foundation-funded Banco de Alimentos Cáritas Puebla Employability Program, she started her own business. As an entrepreneur, she’s providing a path to economic equity for her community and a better future for herself and her family.

Changemakers Turkey: Anadolu Meralari
Following the devastating 2023 earthquakes in Turkey, Didem and hundreds of farmers thought they might lose everything. By participating in the PepsiCo Foundation-backed Anadolu Meralari regenerative agriculture training program, Didem learned new techniques to build her farming business back better than ever, while mentoring other farmers in her community to do the same.

Changemakers United States: Telacu
After graduating high school, Fidel had to work two and three jobs to make ends meet. Once he earned a college degree with the support of a PepsiCo Foundation-funded scholarship through Telacu, everything changed. Now that he’s found career success as a Corporate Affairs leader at PepsiCo, he’s helping the next generation grow their careers as a mentor to others in the Hispanic community.

We’re uniting our volunteer efforts to cultivate prosperity in our communities and advance our pep+ journey
When it comes to volunteering, we are united in our desire to help those around us.
At PepsiCo, we’re a collection of hyperlocal teams that are embedded in our communities. One Smile at a Time, we’re working to spread positivity, build closer connections and support their needs.

Volunteering is a way for all our associates to feel more engaged, have a sense of pride and establish a stronger connection with their local team and community.
 By uniting the efforts of our talented teams through One Smile at a Time, we can maximize our impact and help build prosperity in our communities.

Dreaming big,
one smile at a time.

Dreaming big,
one smile at a time.
Whether it’s a full day of volunteering, an hour on the phone with an elder, or 15 minutes packing boxes, our collective acts can have a big impact.

Through our volunteering platform, all associates have access to local and micro-volunteering opportunities that leverage their talents and skills.
Associates can explore new events or share volunteer opportunities that are close to their heart.

Focusing on three areas to give back - basic needs, social and economic security, and sustainability - helps guide the types of charities, NGOs and organizations we’re partnering with to make a local impact.
All of us, together, can have a big impact on the people and places where we work, live and play.
Research shows that people who volunteer report lower levels of stress, higher self-confidence and reduced risk of depression.
By providing a way for all our associates to give back to their communities, we will bring the PepsiCo Way to life, from acting with integrity and voicing opinions fearlessly, to acting as owners and celebrating success.

Our Nutrition Story
Making food and beverages nutritious 
and delicious, one smile at a time
At PepsiCo, nutrition starts with our recipes.
When we develop new foods in our test kitchens — yes, we cook in kitchens — we use whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, and protein. Our R&D team innovates with new technology too: for example, creating an air-fried crisp that’s just as crispy as a chip fried in oil. Products like Off the Eaten Path’s Veggie Crisps show that snacks made with real veggies can taste great and be fun to eat. We’re also introducing more functional ingredients, like the panax ginseng in soulboost lift.

When we’re sinking a spoon into a hearty bowl of Old Fashioned Quaker Oats, we realize your first thought may not be about the stats on the nutrition label. The whole-grain goodness of Quaker Oats, with a history of more than 140 years, is tried and true. And today the demand for wholesome, nutritious food is high. With good reason. 

We’re making sure to offer nutritious options that consumers are seeking, while still providing the same great taste. Our nutrition goals align with two of the United Nations’ sustainable development goals — Good Health and Well-Being, and Zero Hunger — and we help to work towards a future without malnutrition, hunger or food insecurity. 

As for our trusty favorites, we’ve reduced added sugars, sodium and saturated fat without changing the flavors people know and love (because we know you’d notice). The recipe may have changed, but the familiar crunch of Lay’s will still make you smile from ear to ear. 
Our world isn’t standing still. Neither should our products.
We’re constantly innovating in new areas, reformulating our recipes and looking for ways to improve their nutritional content using high-quality ingredients and new technologies. Here’s how we’ve been changing things up.
The power of Quaker Oats
The Quaker Oats Company, which has been around since the late 1800s, joined the PepsiCo family in 2001. The whole-grain goodness of Quaker Oats endures as a nutritious way to help start your morning - no matter how late you sleep in. Today, the Quaker lineup includes the iconic Old Fashioned Oats along with cold cereals, oat bars and rice cakes.

Nutrition
Product Spotlight
Nutrition innovation is happening in all our R&D centers, where some of the most experienced and creative food scientists in the industry experiment, cross-test and dream up new foods and beverages that are as nourishing as they are flavorful. We invest in companies and people who are pushing the future of nutritious eating forward. Here’s what we’ve been up to.
Building a Greenhouse
In 2017, we launched the Greenhouse Accelerator Program, a mentor-guided program supporting the acceleration of the latest innovators who seek to transform the ways consumers eat, drink and live their lives. We invite these big-dreaming entrepreneurs to collaborate with the experts within PepsiCo — and we award grant funding to companies with promising solutions.
Explore past programs
Offering Positive Food and Beverage Choices 
We’ve been on a journey to make it easier for consumers to choose the great-tasting convenient foods and drinks they want that are nutritious, enjoyable and fit their lifestyle. To do so, we’re taking a multi-pronged approach to transform recipes across our portfolio to accelerate the reduction of added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.
Learn more about Positive Choices in the latest ESG Summary
PepsiCo
Nutrition criteria
We outlined a set of science-based nutrition guidelines called the PepsiCo Nutrition Criteria (PNC) to meet our 2025 company goals. The PNC sets standards for nutrients to limit and nutrients and food groups to encourage. The guidelines are based on recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the National Academy of Medicine and dietary guidelines from several countries. We seek to provide more nutrition in every sip and every bite.

Foodservice
We leverage the best of PepsiCo to drive growth for our partners
Innovative foodservice
If you’ve been drawn to the glowing sign of the Pepsi Lounge at a baseball stadium, plucked a Frappuccino from your office cooler or filled up from a PepsiCo fountain at your favorite restaurant, you’ve gotten a glimpse of the PepsiCo foodservice landscape. Just about anywhere, and on any occasion, we’re there when people crave their favorite drinks and snacks.
Partners
Our approach
We’re committed to helping our partners create a competitive advantage
We do this by providing not only our full lineup of food and drinks, but also our decades of experience — and ,yes, even some of our trade secrets. How we get it done:
Our unparalleled portfolio of food and beverage brands that consumers know, love and trust
Exclusive consumer insights that help businesses make profitable and smart decisions
Innovative, top-of-the-line equipment and service
World-class marketing that attracts consumers — and their loyalty
Foodservice
Our Innovations
SodaStream Professional
Water cooler conversations take on new meaning with the SodaStream Professional - mainly because small talk inevitably turns to how it's cutting down on single-use plastics at the office, making sustainability more than a buzzword. You can fill your reusable bottle with still or sparkling water and customize with a variety of flavors and temperatures - and even keep track of your hydration through a connected app.
FlavorWorks
PepsiCo FlavorWorks is an ever-growing recipe collection that reimagines our products in creative, tasty new ways to inspire our foodservice partners — and it’s been known to spark some rather creative ideas from food bloggers too. See Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Elote on the Cob for reference. But don’t just look at it — try it!
