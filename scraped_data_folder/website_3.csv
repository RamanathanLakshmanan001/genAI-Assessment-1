Chat securely with open or private communication
Most chat in Slack happens in channels – open, organised spaces for messages, files, tools and people – but you can always find a place to communicate with private channels and direct messages.
Organise conversations
You can name and organise your channels by project, client or whatever makes sense for you and your company. Every conversation has a home and a place to move forward.
Put your work history to work
Work smarter by referring to your private messages or open conversations in channels across your company, all of which are automatically saved and searchable.
Always at your fingertips
Stay up to date on all your conversations and keep them going from anywhere with dedicated Slack apps for desktop or mobile.

File sharing, meet channels
In Slack, files and conversations flow in organised, searchable spaces called channels. Channels make it easier to share files and the context around them with the right people – and find those files later on.
Integrated file sharing
From drag-and-drop to quickly adding documents from services such as Google Drive, sharing files is as much a part of Slack as typing and sending messages.
How to add files to Slack
Your files: Safe and secure
We take security seriously, including secure file and document sharing. When you share files in private channels or messages, only the included people can see those files or find them in search.
Different devices, same documents
As you go about your day and switch from one device to the next, Slack automatically and instantly syncs the messages, files and documents in all your channels and messages.

TALK TO SALES
WATCH DEMO
What is Slack Enterprise Encryption Key Management?
Watch video
Bring your own keys
With Slack EKM, you use your own keys – stored in Amazon’s Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – to encrypt messages and files. Administrators can revoke key access on a granular level so teams experience minimal disruption. They keep working as usual, and so does Slack.
Peace of mind for the security-conscious
Slack EKM enhances the ability of organisations to share sensitive conversations and files on Slack while still meeting security requirements.

‘Technology like Slack Enterprise Key Management is rapidly becoming a core requirement for enterprises of all sizes that need enhanced security of their collaboration environment. It becomes more important for enterprises to retain control of their encryption keys.’
Wayne Kurtzman
Research Director for Social, Communities and Collaboration, IDC
Keep work flowing, securely
Your data stays protected while teams keep moving work forward.
Visibility at every step
Get detailed visibility into how your keys are being accessed: usage of your keys to encrypt and decrypt messages and files in Slack is logged in AWS CloudWatch and CloudTrail.
Revoke key access on a granular level
To address security threats, administrators can revoke access in a very targeted manner. Access to messages and files can be revoked at the organisation, workspace, channel, time-frame and file levels.
Keep collaborating in Slack
The Slack experience – from features to performance – remains the same. Teams can keep collaborating using all the Slack features that they know best, even if access to some data is revoked.
Secure enterprises collaborate on Slack
Millions of people around the world use Slack to change the way they work together.

What is Slack?
Slack is your company’s home for everyone and everything – a productivity platform that helps companies to achieve more.
WATCH VIDEO
Move faster by organising your work life
The key to productivity in Slack is organised spaces called channels – a different one for everything that you’re working on. With all the people, messages and files related to a topic in one place, you can move much faster.
Learn more about channels
Focus your time, on your own terms
Give yourself the flexibility to work when, where and how you work best. Take control of notifications, collaborate live or on your own time, and find answers in conversations from across your company.
Support a more flexible work schedule in Slack
Simplify teamwork for everyone
Give everyone that you work with – both inside and outside your company – a more productive way to stay in sync. Respond faster with emoji, keep conversations focused in channels and simplify all your communication into one place.

Run a project, coordinate with your team or just talk things through. Slack is a blank canvas for teamwork.

Why is Slack better than email?
When it comes to Slack vs email, Slack comes out on top for bringing together everything that the modern business needs to get things done.
GET STARTEDTALK TO SALES
Watch video
It’s not that email is broken – it’s limited
Email is useful for sending and receiving information. Slack provides an intuitive platform to do all the other things needed to move work forwards. Slack is a rich interface for collaboration, transparent file sharing and app integrations, while powering productivity with AI.
‘You can’t have a good conversation over email – it’s not quick enough. Coming together in Slack channels allows us to easily discuss day-to-day management topics. That’s invaluable.’
Benjamin Sternsmith,
Former Area Vice President of Sales, Lyft Business
What Slack offers compared to email
Slack isn’t just a tool for sending messages. It’s a place where work flows between all your teams, tools, customers and partners – wherever and whenever you’re working.
TRANSPARENCY
When your teams work in Slack, all their conversations, files and apps become useful context that is searchable by people and AI. No more need to forward a lot of emails to the new person joining the project.
COLLABORATION
File sharing, calls, clips and more are all built into Slack along with real-time messaging, so your teams can truly work together however you work best. Plus, Slack brings internal and external teams together across locations, time zones and working styles, instead of confining work to email’s siloed communication.
INTEGRATIONS
Connect over 2,600 apps to Slack – whether that’s your calendar or the tools that you use every day – and never forget an attachment again.
ORCHESTRATION
Bring the agents in Salesforce and your favourite apps together into a work operating system that allows them to get work done on your behalf.
AUTOMATION
In Slack, you can turn routine meetings and tasks such as huddle meetings, approvals and requests into automated workflows to reduce the back-and-forth.
SECURITY
Collaborating in email opens up the risk of spam and phishing. Slack brings together enterprise-grade security and compliance standards for secure work.
How to switch from email to Slack
Sign up
Create a new Slack workspace in a matter of minutes. It’s free to try for teams of any size.
Invite your colleagues
Slack is better together (no, really, it’s a bit underwhelming by yourself), and it’s easy to invite your team.
Pick up exactly where you left off
Try bringing an email into Slack, and continue the conversation. Your team/boss will thank you.

The doors are open for our housewarming party 🥳 so come on in, take a look around, and let us know what you think. Thanks for coming along on this journey with us!
Feb 27, 2025
Version 3.0.0 of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is here, with lots of goodies for you!
We renamed the slack.json file to .slack/hooks.json, and continue to support slack.json for existing projects. There is now a warning shown in --verbose output to encourage projects to migrate their slack.json to .slack/hooks.json.
We've removed the invalid_app_directory error from any commands run in nested project directories, and now search for the required slack.json file in the project's configuration. We also now also check for this file at .slack/hooks.json.
We now cache the last known manifest export; the cache is used to avoid overwriting changes on app settings. If the manifest is changed on app settings since the last update, a confirmation prompt will appear before making another update via the Slack CLI.
We've moved the top-level commands you know and love, slack create and slack samples, to be sub-commands of the slack project command (they remain aliased as top-level commands though, so there is no change to the user experience).
We've updated the slack doctor command to display the manifest.source value, which will be either local or remote.
We now officially support Bolt for JavaScript and Bolt for Python in the Slack CLI! 🎉
As such, we've updated the slack create command with a new create journey that allows you to choose between different types of apps for Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, and Deno.
We've also added the slack init command, which will initialize an existing Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, or Deno project with Slack CLI support.
We fixed a bug to avoid confusion with regular outputs, and now prefix all separate debug logs with a timestamp.
We fixed a bug to avoid spinning the spinner when outputting with debug logs, or if styles are removed with the --no-color flag.
We fixed a bug to now display uninstalled apps in selections when using the slack collaborators and slack manifest commands.
We fixed a bug with confirming trusted templates that are from a Slack GitHub organization.
We fixed a bug regarding writing console outputs to activity logs during local runs.
We fixed a bug where the Slack CLI would get stuck if one of the goroutines of the slack run command encountered an error; we now exit the slack run command if this happens.
Feb 27, 2025
We previously mentioned that we had deprecated the deno command and removed its listing from the help command. We have now removed the deno command completely. Developers who were depending on this command should now use the deno executable directly.

We've also removed support for the deprecated, pre-release Deno Slack SDK versions that used slack.yaml and project.ts files. The Run-on-Slack platform no longer supports the slack.yaml file format, and no production projects should be affected. The project.ts file was deprecated by the Deno Slack SDK in favor of manifest.ts and manifest.json files.
Feb 13, 2025
Version 2.33.0 of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform will be your valentine!
We now support running CLI commands in project sub-directories.
We've enhanced the script and outputs of hooks to improve debugging.
We've fixed a bug to properly output error messages that may occur when the slack manifest command is run.
We've fixed a bug to distinguish between Slack CLI names if your Slack CLI is named something other than slack.
Feb 3, 2025
A new Block Kit block is now available for use! The markdown block accepts standard markdown and outputs formatted Slack markdown; intended for use in AI apps.
Jan 30, 2025
The Data Access API is here! This API is now available in a limited release for interested partners. Use the Data Access API within AI apps to access all the relevant Slack data you need to ensure a pleasant user experience for AI apps.

Slack updates and changes
See what's new in Slack and what we're gradually rolling out. ✨ 
March 2025
New task-tracking features for lists
When you create a list, you’ll see new task-tracking fields to make it even easier to stay on top of work. You can also add subtasks to any item, and set up list automations with Workflow Builder to send reminders about upcoming and past due dates.
Search across applications with Slack enterprise search
Use enterprise search (available to customers on the Enterprise Grid subscription with the Slack AI add-on) to quickly find information and get answers to questions from all of the apps that your organisation uses like Google Drive, GitHub and more. To get started, org owners or org admins can enable enterprise search for their org.
Custom notification sound for VIPs
Make notifications from your VIPs stand out by setting a custom sound.
Other news
Owners and admins can now manage previews for third-party files so that only the file titles display in Slack.

February 2025
Add Slack actions to Agentforce agents
Agentforce builders can now choose from a set of five Slack actions when creating an agent in Salesforce. Agents can create a canvas, send a direct message and more.
Copy a workflow step to use it again
From Workflow Builder, hover over a workflow step and click the   duplicate icon to copy it.
Automated responses to anomaly events
When certain anomaly events are detected in the audit logs on Enterprise Grid, Slack will automatically end the acting user’s sessions. You can manage anomaly event responses to decide which events end a user’s sessions and which admins are notified.
Other news
Org Owners and Admins can use the external people dashboard to disconnect external people from their organisation and end all Slack Connect conversations.
On Enterprise Grid, Org Owners and Admins can export a summary of their org’s security settings as a CSV.
We’ve released some new tools for content flagging on Enterprise Grid:
Org owners can enable profile content flagging for their organisation.
Members can flag content from external people in Slack Connect conversations to the external organisation for review, provided they’ve also enabled content flagging.
Admins who have been assigned flagged content for review can now be notified with a Slackbot message.
You can now remove all external people from Slack Connect channels, regardless of whether they have permission only to post, or permission to post, invite and more.
January 2025
Agentforce in Slack
Add Agentforce agents to your workspace or Enterprise Grid organisation so that members can work alongside autonomous agents in Slack. To get started with Agentforce, you’ll need a paid Slack subscription and a Salesforce Agentforce licence. To learn more, visit the Slack blog.
Version history for lists
View previous versions of a list or detailed history of an individual item for a record of what’s changed over time. For step-by-step instructions, visit Use lists in Slack.
Other news
Archive individual items or entire views in a list to make room for new information.
Invitations to join a Slack workspace now expire after 30 days. Need more time? Owners and admins can resend invitations to give pending members a chance to accept.
Delegate app management in your Enterprise Grid organisation by assigning certain members the integrations admin system role.
Slack AI is now available with support for German and Portuguese.

December 2024
Share a canvas wherever you need to
View a canvas outside of Slack by printing it or saving it as a PDF.
New admin settings for developer sandboxes
Org owners and admins on Enterprise Grid can now manage invitations, request automation and Slack Connect settings for their developer sandboxes.
Other news
DLP admins can specify the types of conversations – public channels, private channels or direct messages – that they’d like a Slack DLP rule to apply to.
When building a workflow, format the drop-down options in forms as mentions so that users can be notified when their name is selected as a form response.
On Enterprise Grid, you can now set specific workflow usage permissions for external organisations to decide who can use workflows in Slack Connect conversations.

November 2024
Let Slack AI summarise files
Get caught up on new files quickly with automatic AI file summaries.
Create custom list templates
Convert any list to a template and share it with members of your workspace or Enterprise Grid organisation.
Deploy Slack at scale with the MSIX installer
You can now install Slack on Windows at scale using a new MSIX installer package for ARM and 64-bit architectures.
Add people as VIPs
Prioritise your notifications by adding people to your VIP list. Notifications from your VIPs can override your do not disturb settings, and will appear at the top of your Activity feed.
Submit a workspace migration request
Org Owners can now start and manage the process of migrating a workspace into their Enterprise Grid organisation from the admin dashboard.
Other news
You can now add emoji reactions to the text in a canvas.
When creating a Salesforce channel, choose to convert an existing Slack channel instead of starting from scratch.

October 2024
Limit canvas and list sharing with a new setting
When you limit sharing on a canvas or list, only the owner can grant others view or edit access. Owners and admins can also enable limited sharing for all canvases and lists by default.
Keep your sidebar tidy on the go
You can now create, edit and delete custom sidebar sections on the Slack mobile apps.
Power up your channels with templates
Slack templates bundle pre-configured tools like canvases, lists and workflows together to get any job done in Slack. Rather than starting a new process or project from scratch, choose a template, create the channel and be on your way.
Configure Salesforce access in Slack
Set up a connection with Salesforce to easily manage access to Sales Elevate and Salesforce channels.
Recent Slack Sales Elevate updates
We've made the following improvements to Slack Sales Elevate for a better experience:
Search for Salesforce records in Slack
Add Salesforce lists as tabs in any channel
Manage Salesforce record previews
Other news
When reviewing flagged content, org owners and content admins can now claim or assign outstanding reports and leave comments for other reviewers.
Keep track of items in a list by setting reminders to receive a notification at a date and time that you specify.
When adding a connector step to a workflow, you’ll be prompted to authenticate your third-party account before you can proceed with configuring the step.
Delegate management of custom emoji and Slackbot responses in your Enterprise Grid organisation with the customisations manager system role.
To make it easier to multitask, workflow details now open on the right-hand side of Slack instead of in a separate window.
We’ve updated the .GPG key to verify Slack for Linux (beta) package signatures for versions 4.41 and above.
Canvases that you add as a tab in a conversation will now send an update message when someone makes an edit.

September 2024
Data residency now available in Singapore
Data residency for Slack allows organisations to choose where certain types of customer data are stored.
Choose a new font for Slack

Today is the day! As previously mentioned, the Slack platform and developer tools documentation are moving: the shiny new Slack platform documentation is now in beta on docs.slack.dev, and the developer tools documentation has fully moved to its new home on tools.slack.dev. The doors are open for our housewarming party 🥳 so come on in, take a look around, and let us know what you think. Thanks for coming along on this journey with us!
Feb 27, 2025
Version 3.0.0 of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform is here, with lots of goodies for you!
We renamed the slack.json file to .slack/hooks.json, and continue to support slack.json for existing projects. There is now a warning shown in --verbose output to encourage projects to migrate their slack.json to .slack/hooks.json.
We've removed the invalid_app_directory error from any commands run in nested project directories, and now search for the required slack.json file in the project's configuration. We also now also check for this file at .slack/hooks.json.
We now cache the last known manifest export; the cache is used to avoid overwriting changes on app settings. If the manifest is changed on app settings since the last update, a confirmation prompt will appear before making another update via the Slack CLI.
We've moved the top-level commands you know and love, slack create and slack samples, to be sub-commands of the slack project command (they remain aliased as top-level commands though, so there is no change to the user experience).
We've updated the slack doctor command to display the manifest.source value, which will be either local or remote.
We now officially support Bolt for JavaScript and Bolt for Python in the Slack CLI! 🎉
As such, we've updated the slack create command with a new create journey that allows you to choose between different types of apps for Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, and Deno.
We've also added the slack init command, which will initialize an existing Bolt for JavaScript, Bolt for Python, or Deno project with Slack CLI support.
We fixed a bug to avoid confusion with regular outputs, and now prefix all separate debug logs with a timestamp.
We fixed a bug to avoid spinning the spinner when outputting with debug logs, or if styles are removed with the --no-color flag.
We fixed a bug to now display uninstalled apps in selections when using the slack collaborators and slack manifest commands.
We fixed a bug with confirming trusted templates that are from a Slack GitHub organization.
We fixed a bug regarding writing console outputs to activity logs during local runs.
We fixed a bug where the Slack CLI would get stuck if one of the goroutines of the slack run command encountered an error; we now exit the slack run command if this happens.
Feb 27, 2025
We previously mentioned that we had deprecated the deno command and removed its listing from the help command. We have now removed the deno command completely. Developers who were depending on this command should now use the deno executable directly.

We've also removed support for the deprecated, pre-release Deno Slack SDK versions that used slack.yaml and project.ts files. The Run-on-Slack platform no longer supports the slack.yaml file format, and no production projects should be affected. The project.ts file was deprecated by the Deno Slack SDK in favor of manifest.ts and manifest.json files.
Feb 13, 2025
Version 2.33.0 of the developer tools for the Slack automations platform will be your valentine!
We now support running CLI commands in project sub-directories.
We've enhanced the script and outputs of hooks to improve debugging.
We've fixed a bug to properly output error messages that may occur when the slack manifest command is run.
We've fixed a bug to distinguish between Slack CLI names if your Slack CLI is named something other than slack.
Feb 3, 2025
A new Block Kit block is now available for use! The markdown block accepts standard markdown and outputs formatted Slack markdown; intended for use in AI apps.
Jan 30, 2025
The Data Access API is here! This API is now available in a limited release for interested partners. Use the Data Access API within AI apps to access all the relevant Slack data you need to ensure a pleasant user experience for AI apps.

Slack is where the future works
Every day, we refine, iterate and explore how to make work better for everyone. Join us in creating a better future of work that’s more connected, inclusive and flexible:
Connected
We come together wherever we are – across time zones, regions, offices and screens.
Inclusive
Our teams reflect the rich diversity of our world, with equitable access to opportunity for everyone.
Flexible
We believe in your freedom to work when and how you work best, to help us all thrive.
Our core values
These are some of the values that we live by as a company. We work by them, too. We’re building a platform and products that we believe in, knowing that there is real value to be gained from helping people to simplify whatever it is that they do and bring more of themselves to their work, wherever they are.
  Empathy
  Courtesy
  Thriving
  Craftsmanship
  Playfulness
  Solidarity
Working and thriving
As part of the global Salesforce family, we’re proud to offer benefits that help you to feel and do your best. Access a range of benefits, resources and expert guidance to help you to prioritise your well-being, so you can thrive with a healthy body and mind.
Time off to rest, recharge and volunteer

Learn more about benefits
Creating an inclusive environment
We’re dedicated to hiring diverse talent and ensuring that we treat you with respect and support throughout the interview process and once you join Slack. We embrace diversity and strive to create conditions that provide everyone with an equal opportunity to thrive. We offer several programmes and initiatives to foster these values.
Diversity, engagement and belonging
The Diversity, engagement and belonging (DEB) programme unlocks the potential of all employees by investing in an inclusive community centred on education, introspection, opportunity and growth.
Rising Tides
Rising Tides is a six-month sponsorship programme for a talented and diverse group of high performers and emerging leaders at Slack who have historically lacked access to this support. Programme participants receive career development training, executive coaching and one-to-one sponsorship from a Slack executive team member, with a focus on building a supportive community of peers.
Employee resource groups
Employee resource groups (ERGs) support, promote and celebrate groups of employees who have come together around shared characteristics or life experiences.
Partnerships
Partnership initiatives, like our collaboration with The Next Chapter, an apprenticeship programme for formerly incarcerated individuals, underscore Slack’s commitment to DEB. Together with The Last Mile, The Next Chapter trains and hires returning citizens for Slack’s engineering teams.
