Product
Safety.
We hold ourselves to the highest standard
For more than 185 years, your safety and the safety of your world has been at the heart of what we do. That’s why we have a team of more than 500 scientists and professionals and a rigorous safety process to analyze every ingredient—before we ever consider putting it in one of our products.
Our 4-step process
Safety is at the heart of everything we do. Before we market a new product, we go beyond regulatory compliance to ensure every ingredient’s safety through a four-step, science-based process. We use the same process as regulatory agencies around the world, like US FDA, EPA, the EU, the WHO, and others.
1. Doubt
Before we use any ingredient, our scientists start by asking questions. If there’s any doubt about its safety or benefit to you, we won’t use it.
2. Define
We define the ingredient’s safe range using the same science-based standards as major regulatory agencies around the world.
3. Determine
We evaluate all ingredients in the product to ensure they are safe when used - both for you and the environment. If we can’t confirm that, we go back to the drawing board.
4. Diligence
Our last step never ends. Once a product is on shelves, we keep up with new information on each ingredient, collaborating on new products safety methods with regulatory agencies and scientists outside of P&G to make sure we’re up to date.
Most importantly, we listen to you—making sure the products we design meet your expectations for safety and performance.
Scientists of P&G
Watch to learn more about how our scientists formulate safe products for you.
Ingredients
Consumer product safety starts with the ingredients. We know you may have questions and concerns about specific ones. Here, you’ll find more details about common questions we receive regarding product ingredients we choose—and many we actively avoid.
See our ingredients
Consumer Products Safety Commission Certificates of Conformance
Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC) Certificates of Conformance are issued for all products under the jurisdiction of the CPSC. P&G issues Certificates of Conformance for Children’s Products (those primarily designed or intended for children 12 years of age or younger) and for General Use Products which are intended for use by consumers of all ages.
For more information regarding CPSC regulations, consult the CPSC website.
To review Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and product ingredients visit the SmartLabel® website.

Ingredients.
Safety is our first ingredient. We know you want to know as much as you can about our products and their ingredients. That’s why we’re continuing to provide transparency around our ingredient innovation and safety science. If you don’t find what you’re looking for here or on P&G brand sites, contact us here.
Ingredient choices and how we make them
Some people believe natural product ingredients are safer to use than man-made, synthetic ones. The reality is that it’s not that simple; both natural and synthetic ingredients have a safe range and an unsafe range. Even basics like sunlight, oxygen, and water have safety limits. So what goes into choosing our product ingredients?
1. Safety
First we define the safe range for every ingredient, whether natural or synthetic. Then we apply the same science-based approach as regulatory agencies around the world.
2. Performance
Every ingredient has a role in delivering the performance you expect from our products. We seek to use the best ingredients for our products so that you can use them with confidence.
3. Sustainable Sourcing
Synthetic ingredients can oftentimes be more sustainable than natural ingredients because they require fewer resources. Sustainable features of a product ingredient depend on the resources used in creating it, harvesting it, making the product and then ultimately using the product. And we’re also doing the legwork to ensure we use the most sustainable and earth-friendly solutions.
Ingredients for good
Ingredients we do not use
Here is a list of some of the most common materials we get asked about that we do not use as ingredients in any of our formulated products (health care, skin and personal cleansing, hair care, laundry, home care, and oral care):
Alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates
Benzene
Bisphenol A (not in formulas*)
Heavy metals: Arsenic, Lead, Chromium VI, Mercury, Cadmium, Nickel
Microbeads
Organotins (TBT, DBT, MBT, DOT)
PVC (not in formulas*)
PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons)
PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls)
Phthalates**
Triclosan
Triclocarban**
This list is not exhaustive but a starting point. For specific product ingredients, please see the Brand website here.
We have strict product safety limits in place when any of these materials could be found in tiny amounts due to their natural (or background) presence in water, the environment, or as part of the manufacturing process.
* We do not use BPA or PVC in any of our product formulas. Our use of PVC and BPA is restricted to very small amounts in some product packaging like pressurized aerosol cans or electrical devices where their unique performance is essential for product safety. We will consider new material options as soon as they do arise.
** We do not use these ingredients in new products and are exiting them. More details on our exit timings for these materials can be found in the Common Ingredient Questions section above.
Understanding Specific Ingredients
Even though we ensure our products are safe to use before they hit shelves, we know there’s a lot of conversation around certain product ingredients. Here's our point of view:
1,4-Dioxane
Phosphates
Phthalates
Triclosan and Triclorcarban
Microbeads and Microplastics
Fragrance Ingredients
Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Menstrual Products
Fragrance Ingredients List
Since 2020 we have published fragrance ingredients down to 0.01% for all our fragranced products in the US and Canada.

Preservatives (including parabens and others)
Preservatives help keep all of us safe by preventing growth of bacteria and mold during the use of consumer products. Different product types need different preservatives that work best for that particular formula. You can rest assured that all of our preservatives comply with applicable regulations and safe limits wherever they are sold.
To find out what preservative is used in your product, you will find more information via Smartlabel® for US and Canada.
A small number of products require a different preservative not listed above, including potassium sorbate, benzalkonium chloride, dehydroaceticacid and chlorhexidine digluconate. They are indicated on the ingredient list in the product used.

Fragrance
Ingredients.
Fragrances are naturally all around us and often part of making your daily routine enjoyable. We offer a range of products and fragrances that cater to different preferences, whether you choose a product with a powerful scent, a light background note, or perfume-free variants.
Safety is the first ingredient
Our unique product perfumes are blended with the greatest care and utmost attention to safety.
We exclude over 170 ingredients from our fragrances—more extensive than the list of ingredients banned by the international Fragrance Association (IFRA). Our unique perfumes are blended with the greatest care and utmost attention to safety. We conduct an additional safety assessment of our fragrances and their ingredients.
You can also learn more about the safety behind fragrance ingredients by visiting The Fragrance Conservatory.
More about the fragrance ingredients we use and those we do not
While all our product fragrance ingredients are safe to use, we understand some people want to learn more. If you would like to find the specific fragrance ingredients for a P&G product in the U.S. or Canada, please visit the brand website (search for brands here) or go to SmartLabel®.
We are providing a list of fragrance ingredients we do not use below. You will see that we exclude many common food allergens in our fragrances, including Animal Derived Materials, Egg Derivatives, Milk Derivatives, Gluten, Barley, Rye, Soy Derivatives, Fish or Shellfish. We are constantly innovating our fragrance offerings to give you the best possible product experience, so this list will be updated regularly.
Fragrance ingredients we do not use
This ingredients list includes fragrance ingredients in alphabetical order that we have never used, as well as some ingredients we chose to stop using and are removing from product fragrances. We update this list regularly.

Our Commitment
To #BeCrueltyFree.
We are calling for an end to all animal testing of cosmetic products globally, and we’re proud to partner with Humane Society International’s #BeCrueltyFree Campaign to advance that vision.
Our support of #BeCrueltyFree is another step in our long-term commitment to make animal testing obsolete. Our journey began over 40 years ago through ongoing research, investment and partnerships to develop and promote the use of alternatives to animal testing. These efforts have contributed to the greater good, enabling us and others to develop products that have not been tested on animals. Our contributions include:
Investing more than $480 million over 40 years in alternatives to animal testing, our researchers pioneering over 25 non-animal methods, publishing more than 1,000 scientific articles.
Partnering with leading international animal welfare organizations, academia, and industry coalitions to promote use of non-animal, cruelty-free methods around the world.
Advocating for public use of non-animal methods and adoption by scientists and policy makers around the world for over 25 years.

Working Together to End Animal Testing
P&G has invested in non-animal test method development for decades and is partnering with leading international animal welfare organizations, academia, industry coalitions and policy makers to promote alternatives to using animals. Together, we have achieved a great deal which includes stopping animal testing for our cosmetics products many years ago. In fact, P&G no longer animal tests any consumer product unless required by law and we are committed to make animal testing obsolete.

Testimonials
For more than 20 years, the Humane Society family of organizations has collaborated with Procter & Gamble to advance the development and regulatory acceptance of non-animal testing approaches. We are excited to welcome P&G as an official supporter of our #BeCrueltyFree campaign to achieve a legislative end to cosmetic animal testing and trade in all major cosmetic markets worldwide.
Troy Seidle,
Vice President of the Humane Society International
We’re pleased to support the Humane Society International in the quest to end cosmetic animal testing. Already, Procter & Gamble has invested more than $480 million over the past 40 years in developing non-animal test methods and we will continue to be a force for good in this field as we work together to end animal testing for good.
Victor Aguilar,
Chief Research, Development and Innovation Officer, Procter and Gamble
PETA is delighted to be working with Procter & Gamble in certifying its products as cruelty-free and in ending requirements for these tests by regulatory authorities. Our partnership on this vitally important issue is a win-win for the animals and for consumers.

Taking Action Around the World
For generations, P&G and our brands have united to support people and communities around the world in times of need.
Sharing The Power of Clean Water
Since 2004, we’ve shared our cleaning innovation to deliver clean water to children and families in need through our P&G Children’s Safe Drinking Water Program (CSDW), powered by the P&G Purifier of Water packet. Each 4-gram packet acts as a mini-water treatment plant, purifying 10 liters of contaminated water in just 30 minutes by killing bacteria and viruses and removing parasites. A family can have clean drinking water for an entire day using only the packet, a bucket, a spoon, and a cloth.
Over the past 20 years, the CSDW Program has delivered more than 23 billion liters of clean water in over 100 countries working with more than 150 partners.

Delivering Relief in Times of Need
Through our long-standing partnerships with disaster relief organizations, we’re able to provide the comforts of home and a sense of normalcy through services, products, and financial donations, making each day a little better for communities impacted by natural disasters and other unexpected challenges.
During Times Of Crisis, Our Actions Are Guided By Three Core Principles:
Protecting the health, safety, and wellbeing of P&G people.
Serving people around the world who count on our brands and the benefits they provide.
Supporting communities in need through our longstanding partnerships with local and global relief agencies.
P&G brands help provide daily household and personal care essentials to people during times of crisis and are uniquely positioned to help meet the needs of those in underserved communities who are disproportionately impacted. Improving the daily lives of people and helping the communities in which we live and work to prosper is core to who we are as a company.
–Marc S. Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer
Building Homes and Communities
P&G and Habitat for Humanity work together to create impact through programs in a dozen countries constructing homes and upgrading hygiene facilities and outdoor spaces in underserved communities around the world.
Positive Impact Where We Live & Work
Different regions have different needs. To meet the unique needs of the people we serve and help where our brands and services can make a difference, our programs are designed in partnership with local organizations working in communities every day to improve health and wellbeing.
United Way
Our commitment goes back more than a hundred years to when our founder’s grandson, William Cooper Procter, helped start the first community fund that would evolve to be United Way today. Since that time, P&G and our employees and retirees have supported its mission in communities throughout the Americas.

Environmental
sustainability.
At P&G, Environmental Sustainability is embedded in how we do business across our operations, supply chain, and brands. The recipe for success is in the power of AND – innovation that solves everyday problems through irresistible superiority that drives market growth and is more environmentally sustainable – helping to fulfill our purpose of improving lives for generations to come.
3 Levels of Impact
We create value by making sustainability an important consideration of how we design superior products and services through four science-based pillars — Climate, Waste, Water and Nature. Our strategy seeks to deliver environmental impact at three levels: reducing our own impact, enabling people to reduce their impact, and helping scale solutions across industries.

Climate
Learn more about P&G’s efforts to reach net zero by 2040.
P&G’s ambition is to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our supply chain and operations – from raw material to retailer – by 2040. Our climate journey began over a decade ago with goals at our own manufacturing facilities. Since then, we have expanded and accelerated our efforts to address GHG emissions across the life cycle of our products, and within our operations and supply chain.
Our focus is on significantly reducing absolute GHG emissions in our operations and supply chain to reach our net zero ambition by 2040. Our ambition is to balance any remaining emissions from our operations and supply chain as of 2040 by advancing natural or technical solutions that remove an equivalent amount of GHG emissions from the atmosphere. To help pace our progress toward 2040, we have established near-term science-based targets for 2030. We have also shared a Climate Transition Action Plan that outlines our comprehensive approach to accelerating climate action and the key challenges ahead. Our net zero ambition will require partnership across the private, nonprofit and public sectors to support the transformation of energy and transportation infrastructures needed at scale.
Net Zero 2040
Climate Transition Action Plan
Climate Progress
Waste
P&G’s aim is to support a more circular value chain where more materials are recycled and remade to remain in use instead of becoming waste. We are working to design all our consumer packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2030.
P&G provides everyday products of superior quality and value to people around the world. Product packaging materials are useful in providing product protection. Lighter weight packaging helps lower GHG emissions during transportation.
We believe we can unlock more worth from packaging materials long after their first use. P&G is teaming up with industry coalitions and nonprofits to invent and find scalable solutions to reduce waste and increase recyclability and reuse of packaging and materials.
Water
How are we contributing to a water positive future?
Water is essential for the making and use of our products. Our comprehensive strategy includes reducing water in our operations, restoring water in 18 water-stressed areas around the world where we operate, and responding to water challenges through innovation and partnerships.

At P&G, we understand that the success of our business is intricately linked to the health and sustainability of the natural environment.
We are committed to responsible sourcing of key commodities like wood pulp, palm oil and paper packaging together with respecting human, labor, and land tenure rights in our supply chains. We are investing in a portfolio of projects to help protect, restore or improve priority landscapes and we are supporting natural climate solutions.
We recognize we cannot do this alone, which is why we collaborate with partners for broader impact.

Keeping Forests as Forests – Now and for Generations to Come
Forests are critical to supporting life on earth and protecting them is essential to the people and wildlife that call them home. We are committed to zero deforestation in our supply chain. For example, we require our wood pulp in products be third-party certified - for every tree we use at least one is regrown. Learn more at pginvestor.com. We are helping protect and restore nature through partnerships and projects around the world and are committed to a regenerative approach. We are planting more than a million trees through partnerships to protect and restore forests that touch 35 countries and are committed to the long-term health of natural ecosystems that are essential to people, wildlife and the planet.

P&G
Responsible
Beauty.
We are committed to being a positive force for beauty in the world, to create a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient future for all.
We believe in a future where beauty products offer superior value to people and are sustainable; where no one should have to make trade-offs between products that are good for themselves, for society, or for the planet.
P&G Responsible Beauty is not a separate thing we do on the side — it’s how we do business every day around the world.
– Alex Keith,
CEO, P&G Beauty
P&G Beauty established the P&G Responsible Beauty Advisory Council (RBAC) consisting of six NGOs, each selected for their expertise in nature, health, and human rights. RBAC members inform the P&G Beauty team about latest research, best practices, and new technologies that help advance the Responsible Beauty Action Plan.

Our Five Interconnected Guiding Principles
Action is urgent and innovation is critical. We must think and do things differently, to enable the people we serve to make positive choices for their lives and the health of the planet. To make meaningful progress we need a total systems approach and avoid “problem switching”—solving one issue but creating another down the road.
For beauty, this means going beyond environmental practices to address the interdependence of all aspects of product development and corporate behavior—all activities that matter to you when choosing a beauty product and the world in which we live.
Quality and performance
It all starts with understanding the diverse beauty needs and desires of women and men all over the world. Our products deliver outstanding and noticeable benefits. We use high-quality ingredients from both science and nature, and our product testing goes far beyond industry standards.

Ethics And Corporate Responsibility
Our Purpose,
Values and
Principles.
At P&G, we serve consumers around the world with one of the strongest portfolios of trusted, quality and leadership brands and have operations in nearly 70 countries. As we serve the world's consumers with daily use products, we believe in, and have publicly committed to, doing what's right and being a good corporate citizen.
Our Purpose, Values and Principles (PVPs) are the foundation of who we are. Our Purpose is to provide branded products and services of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the world’s consumers, now and for generations to come. As a result, consumers will reward us with leadership sales, profit and value creation, allowing our people, our shareholders and the communities in which we live and work to prosper. Our Values of Integrity, Leadership, Ownership, Passion for Winning and Trust shape how we work with each other and with our partners. And our Principles articulate our deliberate approach to conducting work every day. Our philosophy is that a reputation of trust and integrity is built over time, is earned every day and provides lasting value for our stakeholders.
Good Governance
Our PVPs further inform our approach to corporate governance. We believe that strong governance practices contribute to better results for shareholders. We maintain strong governance principles, policies and practices that support Board and management accountability and serve the best interests of our Company and our shareholders.
Board Leadership and Oversight
Strong leadership and effective oversight have remained of critical importance as companies navigate ongoing uncertainty and volatility, and greater external scrutiny. Our commitment to and guiding principles for strong governance continue to provide an important foundation for our Company as we navigate these challenges and respond to new opportunities.
The key principles and practices we follow include:
Fully independent Board Committees;
Annual assessment and determination of the Board’s leadership structure;
Election of a Lead Director, with significant governance responsibilities if the Chairman/CEO roles are combined;
Ongoing review of the Company’s key risk areas, including annual review of the Company’s key legal and compliance risks, including mitigation strategies and compliance priorities, and review of the conclusions and recommendations generated by the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process;
Significant Director interaction with senior business leaders, both in business and operations reviews and in oversight of succession planning; and
Board review of and engagement in key aspects of ESG, including our Environmental Sustainability strategy and progress, our Equality & Inclusion strategy and efforts to create a culture of inclusion, and work to make a positive Community Impact through providing disaster relief and other critical humanitarian support.
We describe these and other practices in the Governance section of our ESG Portal in our Corporate Governance Guidelines in each Committee’s charter, and in our annual proxy statement.
Keeping Privacy & Security Strong
Protecting important business and personal information is critical to building and maintaining a relationship of trust with all of our stakeholders. With that in mind, P&G has developed global and regional corporate compliance processes to help ensure that privacy and security are driven through the organization in a sustainable manner, including with relevant suppliers. We know that our stakeholders expect P&G to design appropriate measures to transparently process personal data and strong information security controls to help safeguard critical business and personal information. For more information on how we keep privacy and security strong, visit our Privacy Policy.

Who we are.
Making every day more than ordinary
Our brands are trusted in millions of living rooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, and bathrooms—and have been passed down from generation to generation. We are the people behind the brands you trust, and we’re committed to making peoples’ lives better in small but meaningful ways, every day.
As P&G grows, we stay grounded in our purpose, values, and principles and a deep-rooted understanding between each other and our company that being our best and doing our best—for the people who buy our products, for one another, and for the world around us—will lead to mutual success.
We believe in finding small but meaningful ways to improve lives—now and for generations to come.
We make superior quality products
See our brands
And use every ounce of our power to make a difference
See our impact
There is no single equation for success at P&G, because no two P&G people or careers are alike. Just as we strive to deliver a superior consumer experience, we aim to deliver a superior employee value equation as well.
We celebrate the uniqueness of each employee’s journey because we know that loyalty and success stem from the times when people feel inspired to make a difference, have equal opportunity and multiple ways to continue growing, feel pride in making an impact and know they’re being valued and rewarded for their contributions to their team’s and our company’s success.
We believe when we support our employees’ wellbeing, they are better able to contribute to the success of the Company and achieve their personal goals. That is why P&G’s Total Rewards package is focused on supporting four key wellbeing areas: financial, mental, physical and work-life wellbeing.

A Grandfather Inspired by His Grandson: Pampers
While watching his first grandchild, a P&G researcher quickly realizes the mess of cloth diapers and the need to carry them until returning home. This leads him and fellow researchers to develop a better & more affordable disposable diaper. Since then, Pampers has continuously advanced—moving from pins to tapes, becoming thinner and more cloth-like, and designed for babies at every stage of development.

First R&D Lab
R&D quickly becomes a critical function at P&G and our first lab is added to the Ivorydale facility. By the 1920s, R&D is an integrated division of our company, employing a staff of several hundred young men and women. The Research Department develops ways to improve products, then passes their findings on to be translated into new manufacturing processes.

2023 Citizenship Report
2023
Citizenship
Report
The information in this report covers the period of July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023.
Delivering For All Our Stakeholders
Jon R. Moeller
Chairman of the Board,
President and Chief Executive Officer
P&G’s objective is to deliver balanced top- and bottom-line growth while serving the needs of all stakeholders – consumers, customers, employees, society and shareowners.
We take an integrated approach in every aspect of our Citizenship work. It is not managed centrally or by a separate organization. Each business owns the work and the budget that enables P&G to continue making progress in these important areas.
Our efforts in Environmental Sustainability are important in creating value while improving P&G’s environmental impact, enabling consumers to reduce their footprint, and working collaboratively across industries to address some of the most pressing challenges.
We start where we have the most control – our operations. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 58% since 2010, already surpassing our initial 2030 goal of a 50% reduction. We have now set our sights on a 65% reduction by 2030 (versus a 2010 baseline). We are recycling approximately 3.5 billion liters of water a year in our facilities, with a goal of 5 billion liters recycled and reused annually by 2030. We are increasing our use of recycled plastic resin while also decreasing our total use of plastic in packaging – less plastic overall and a higher proportion from recycled sources.

Read more about P&G
In 2023, P&G celebrated our 186th anniversary
A Culture that Fuels Innovation and Prioritizes Wellbeing
P&G is one of the largest consumer packaged goods companies in the world. Innovation and the passion of talented teams helped us grow into a global company that is governed responsibly and ethically, that is open and transparent, and that supports good causes and protects the environment. Many things have changed through the years, but the importance of P&G people to P&G’s success is enduring. We recognize that to attract, develop and retain the best talent, we need to offer a superior employee experience.
At P&G, we provide benefits, resources, and learning opportunities to support the physical, mental, financial, and work-life well-being of our employees so they can contribute to the success of the business while achieving their own life goals.

How You Control Your Personal Data
You are in control of your personal data. You can exercise your rights and change your preferences anytime.
Data Subject Rights Requests
Depending on your location (the jurisdiction in which you are a resident), you may have different data subject rights available to you. These may include requests for access, erasure, rectification/correction, to opt out of receiving marketing emails or texts, object to our use of your email address or phone number for advertising, etc. To submit a Data Subject Rights requests for your jurisdiction, click here.
You can also tell us to stop sending you email and text messages by following the opt-out instructions sent with these communications. Please be aware that we may need to keep certain information to honor your choices (e.g., if you tell us to stop sending marketing emails, we will need your email address on file so that our systems remember that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications to that email address).
Also, there are some situations where we may be unable to grant your request (e.g., deleting transaction data where we have a legal obligation to keep it, or for fraud prevention, security, or to protect the privacy of others, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, among other things). 
Traditional Online Behavioral Advertising
How you exercise choice as to interest-based ads
Advertising Industry Opt-Outs
For the U.S., to exercise choice with respect to interest-based advertising, you can utilize the opt-out mechanism provided by the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) by clicking here (for browsers) or here (for app-based opt-outs).
The Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of certain Interest-based Ads delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of such targeted advertising or to use the NAI tool, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
For Europe, you may click here to learn more about the DAA-Europe’s opt-out program.
For Canada, you may click here to learn more about the DAA Canada’s opt-out program.
To opt-out of Unified ID 2.0 globally click here.
Online Platform Opt-Outs
P&G may share identifiers connected to you, such as a hashed version of your email address, with online platforms, including but not limited to those listed below, for the purpose of sending you interest-based advertising. To learn more about how these platforms may use your data and about how you can control the use of this data, please follow the links below.
Google
Meta
Microsoft / Bing
Pinterest
Reddit
Snap
TikTok
Please be aware that, even if you opt-out of certain kinds of interest-based ads, you may continue to receive other ads. Further, opting out of one or more NAI or DAA members only means that those selected members should no longer under the DAA / NAI rules deliver certain targeted ads to you. This will affect services provided by the applicable DAA / NAI members but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads from non-participating parties. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or web browser(s), or use a non-browser-based method of access, your DAA / NAI browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Mobile device opt-outs will not affect browser-based Interest-based ads even on the same device, and you must opt-out separately for each device. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third party opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
You can also prevent or reduce getting interest-based ads on websites by declining cookies in your browser(s), or on mobile devices by declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually present when you install them or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.
Please note that you may also receive personalized ads based on your email address or phone number, if you have provided those to us for marketing purposes. To opt out of that usage, please contact us here (Note: Please ensure you select the correct location / country of your residence by clicking the button in the top left corner).
You will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of interest-based ads. Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from our brands on your computer or mobile devices. These ads, however, are based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads. Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile phone or computer viewing activities over time and across unrelated services, contextual ads are ads shown to you based on the context of the specific site you are visiting. For example, you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly new or expecting parents as visitors. You should also know that we may still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer research, or detecting fraud, pursuant to applicable laws.
How You Can Control Cookies
You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent to your computer. However, this may prevent our sites or services from working properly. You can also set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing.
When you opt-out of interest-based advertising, an opt-out cookie is sent to your browser that indicates that you no longer want to receive interest-based ads. Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you decide to delete all cookies on your browser. This means that you will need to opt-out again on each browser where you have deleted cookies if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.
In some markets and on some of our websites, we offer a cookie consent management platform which allows you to exercise choice with respect to certain categories of cookies. If this is available, this may appear as a cookie banner and/or as an icon that is visible on the applicable websites. We may also provide similar technology in mobile apps, which, if available, will be accessible through the applicable app’s settings menu.
U.S. State Privacy Laws
See our “
U.S. State Privacy Notice
“ below for information required by certain state privacy laws, and information regarding privacy rights under such laws.
Additional Information for EEA, Switzerland, UK and Serbia Residents
If you live in the EEA, Switzerland, the UK or Serbia, or are physically in the EEA, Switzerland, Serbia or the UK, you may access the personal data we hold about you, request that inaccurate, outdated, or no longer necessary information be corrected, erased, or restricted, and ask us to provide your data in a format that allows you to transfer it to another service provider. You also may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on your consent for the processing of your personal data. And you may object to our processing of your personal data (this means ask us to stop using it) where that processing is based on our legitimate interest (this means we have a legitimate reason for using the data for a certain purpose and this reason is not outweighed by your interest in P&G not using it). To make a request, please contact us.
If you would like more information about data protection and your personal data rights in general, please visit the European Data Protection Supervisor’s site at https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/ or the UK Information Commissioner’s Office site at https://ico.org.uk or the or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner site at https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html the Serbia Commissioner (for information of public importance and personal data protection of personal data) at https://www.poverenik.rs/en/home.html. If you are not happy with our response to your requests, you may lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your country.
Procter and Gamble España SA adheres to the Code of Conduct for Data Protection in AUTOCONTROL, accredited by the Spanish Data Protection Agency and therefore is subject to its extrajudicial system of data processing complaints when related to data protection and advertising, available for those interested on the website www.autocontrol.es.
Dental Professionals
If you are a dental professional and have provided your personal data to us as part of one of our professional outreach programs, including through https://www.dentalcare.com, please contact us through your local P&G representative, e.g. Oral-B.
Healthcare Professionals
If you are a healthcare professional and have provided your personal data to us as part of one of our professional outreach programs or any other form of collaboration, please contact us through your local or regional P&G representative.
Consumer Research Participants
To make a request with respect to personal data we may have as part of your participation in one of our research studies, please see the contact information provided on your consent form or call or visit your research center.
How We Gather & Use Personal Data
Like most brands, we collect personal data as you interact with us or when you share personal data with third parties that in turn can be shared with us. We do this respectfully and carefully to protect your rights. Personal data can help us better understand your interests and preferences as a consumer and a person.
How We Collect Personal Data
We collect personal data about you in many ways and from many places. Some of the personal data we collect may include personal data that can be used to identify you; for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or postal address. In some jurisdictions, things like IP address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered personal data. Some of the personal data we collect may be considered sensitive personal data or special category data and may include, account login information, financial information, precise geolocation data, government identifiers, racial or ethnic origin, mental & physical health / condition, Consumer Health Data, sex life or sexual orientation, transgender / non binary status, children’s data, criminal background, genetic data and biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual etc.
You Share it Directly
You give us your personal data directly for example when signing up for an account on our websites or mobile apps or by calling or emailing us, or while participating in a P&G survey or contest etc. We may ask for things like your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us to send you information about our products and services—for example, to your home address, email address, or by texting you.
You Interact with Websites & Emails
We may use technologies that automatically collect information when you visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services. For example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer’s browser) to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address, and about your online activities such as web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have not opened an email from us.
You Use Mobile Apps & Other Devices
To give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or our “smart” devices in your home. You consent to this when downloading the app or installing household internet connected devices. This information could include your mobile phone or other device advertising ID, information about your phone’s operating system, how you use the app or device, your physical location, and other information that is considered personal data in some jurisdictions. You will get a pop-up notice on your phone or device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are accessing the internet) or to collect or access other personal data, as required by the applicable laws.
You Connect with Partners or Third Parties
We may get information that other companies share with or sell to us. For example, you may have given consent for another company to share your personal data with us when you signed up for telecom services or a retailer loyalty points program. Where possible, we may also collect personal data from publicly available sources, such as from internet postings, blog entries, videos, or social media sites. We may also receive personal data from other companies, such as consumer data resellers, who are in the business of collecting or aggregating information about you sourced from publicly available databases (in line with local legal requirements as applicable) or from consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your personal data. This might include information about your income level, age, gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.

How We Use Cookies
Cookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web. They store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit. You can learn more about how to control cookies
here
.
We use cookies in several ways, such as:
to allow you to browse the website and use its features
to serve you with relevant advertising and measure the effectiveness of such advertising
to ensure that you are not shown an ad more than you should be (called “frequency capping”)
to learn more about the way you interact with P&G content
to help us improve your experience when visiting our websites
to remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there is no need for you to customize the website on each visit
to identify errors and resolve them
to analyze how well our websites are performing
Types of Cookies We Use
Strictly Necessary Cookies:  These cookies (also sometimes referred to as “essential”) allow the page to load or provide some essential functionality without which the page would not work (i.e., store your data in a shopping cart).
Functional Cookies:  These cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you come back again. For example, if you choose to read the site in French on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear automatically in French. Not having to select a language preference every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly for you.
Advertising / Targeting Cookies: These cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the products you buy. That data allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the things you like or need. It also allows us to limit the number of times you see the same advertisement.
Analytics / Performance Cookies: These cookies tell us how you use our websites, like which pages you visited and which links you clicked. This helps us measure and improve the performance of our websites. We use different analytics cookies in different jurisdictions. In many cases, we use Google Analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
Social Media Cookies: These cookies, that are set by a range of social media services that we have added to the site, allow you to share our content with your friends and networks and enable us to reach you with ads on those social platforms related to your visits on our sites. The cookies of some social media sites, e.g., Facebook, are also used for ad targeting.
Interest-Based Advertising
When you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we believe you would like to see. For example, you may receive advertisements for Tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that sell children’s clothing or school supplies. And from that information we may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested in a powerful laundry-cleaning product. In this way, we intend to send you relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you. To learn more about your choices regarding interest-based advertising go
here
.
We Learn from Groups of Consumers Sharing Similar Interests:  We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same interests. For example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados” if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a “bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts or sales. We may infer these things about you based on your activity on certain web pages, links you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails, as well based on other information we have collected, such as from retailer partners and other third parties. We group together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends, habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly online and/or offline. By doing this, we can find and serve many others who “look like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information.
We Link Other Information to Your Cookie and Device IDs:  Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such as information about the products you buy offline or information that you provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites. We generally do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you. For example, we could know that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor aficionado group based on a person’s web site visits, age, gender, and shopping habits. Should we want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and app viewing history), we will do so in accordance with applicable laws.
We May Know You Across Your Computers, Tablets, Phones and Devices:  We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with device ID EFG15647. This means that you may search for diapers on your laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and then later see an ad for our Pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone. We might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone because, for example, they sign on to the same Wi-Fi network every day at the same time. Understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across your devices. And this is important because that way you don’t get annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive.
Addressable Media: When you provide us with your personal data via our sites or apps, we may use an encryption of that data – or a substitute identifier such as The Trade Desk's UID2 -- to serve you with ads we think you may like. We do this generally by uploading a pseudonymized version (replaced with artificial letters or numbers) of your email address, phone number, or your mobile advertising ID to a platform that offers ad space (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, etc.). We also use that same data to serve you advertising through what is called the open web. This means you may see relevant ads from us on sites like nytimes.com or apps or other places like digital TV that participate in online auctions of their ad inventory.
Advanced Matching: Some of our sites use the Advanced Matching features offered by Social Media Platforms to its advertisers (e.g. Facebook’s Advanced Matching, TikTok’s Advanced Matching, etc.). Through Advanced Matching, we may send some of the personal data you enter on our site form fields (e.g., your name, email address, and phone number – not any sensitive personal data or special category data) in a pseudonymized format to the Social Media Platform, or the Social Media Platform Pixel will pseudonymize and pull that data automatically, for the purpose of helping associate you with your browser cookie or device ID. We do this so that we can better target and measure the effectiveness of our advertising on the respective Social Media platforms. This is how we can know that if we showed you an ad on a given Social Media Platform, you clicked on it, came to our site and bought something – or not – and therefore whether we should continue to buy ads on that Social Media Platform – or not.
Google Analytics Advertising Features: Some of our sites use Google Remarketing Lists for Search Ads with Analytics (“RLSA”), which is a service they offer to advertisers. When individuals visit our sites, Google Analytics collects data about their visits (and not any sensitive personal data or special category data). If a visitor is signed into their Google account, we are able to provide that user with interest-based advertising when they conduct a Google search for terms related to the P&G site they visited. For example, if you are signed into a Google account when visiting our Head & Shoulders website, we may provide you with Head & Shoulders advertising when you search for “dandruff shampoo” on Google. Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. To understand how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps, visit here. You may opt out of Google Analytics at any time.
Other Technologies We May Use
Proximity-Based Beacons:  Beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are on-sale as you walk through a store. Beacons only talk to your device when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the mobile application associated with a particular beacon. In turn, apps may provide us location information to help customize advertising and offers to you. For example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon.
Pixels: These are small objects embedded into a web page but are not visible. They are also known as ""tags,” “web bugs,” or ""pixel gifs."" We may use pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing activities. We may also include pixels in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open them and click on their links. This helps us understand whether you are an active user (which will prevent your data from being deleted due to inactivity). It also helps us measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and derive insights and analysis, that we will use to personalize the content of our communication and to guide our marketing decisions (for example, if you opened an email but did not click on the links in it, we may decide to retarget you on Facebook).
Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs:  We use software code in our mobile apps to collect information as you use our apps which is like what cookies collect on our websites. This will be information like your mobile phone identifiers (iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs) and the way you use our apps.
Precise Geolocation:  We may receive information about your exact location from things like global positioning system (GPS) coordinates (longitude and latitude) when you use our mobile apps. You will always get a pop-up notice on your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to know exactly where you are in the world. You should understand that we will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a broader city, postal code, or province. For example, we do not consider it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in Manila, Philippines.
Site and App Content
Plugins:  Our websites may include plugins from other companies such as social networks. An example of a plugin is the Facebook “Like” button. These plugins may collect information (e.g., the URL of the page you visited) and send it back to the company that created them. This may happen even if you do not click on the plugin. These plugins are governed by the privacy policy and terms of the company that created them, even though they appear on our sites.
Logins:  Our websites may allow you to log in using your account with another company such as, for example, “Login with Facebook.” When you do this, we will have access only to the information that you have given us consent to receive from your account settings in the other company’s account you’re using to log in with.
User Content:  Some of our sites and apps will allow you to upload your own content for contests, blogs, videos, and other functions. Please remember that any information you submit or post becomes public information. We do not have control over how others may use the content you submit to our sites and apps. We are not responsible for such uses in ways that may violate this privacy policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety.
Links:  P&G sites may include links to other sites, which we do not control. Those sites will be governed by their own privacy policies and terms, not ours.
Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
Automated decision-making implies making a decision using automated means without human involvement. Profiling is a form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal characteristics of an individual for the purpose of analyzing or predicting, for example, that individual’s personal preferences, interests, likely behavior, etc.
As you have read in this Privacy Policy, we collect a variety of types of personal data both from you and from other commercially available sources. This data may be combined and analyzed, including sometimes using algorithms, to identify links between certain behaviors and personal characteristics. P&G users who have similar characteristics or have performed similar actions are likely to share similar interests in our products: based on this analysis, segments of P&G consumers are created and targeted accordingly with relevant offers via email, online advertising, and social media.
This process allows us to customize our communications to your declared or inferred interests. However, we will not conduct any automated decision-making processes, including profiling, that can produce legal effects or that can similarly significantly affect your rights and freedoms, as per Art. 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, should we want to engage in more intrusive profiling and tracking practices, we will always inform you and, where legally required, ask for your consent before doing so or provide you with the right to opt-out.
How We Disclose Personal Data
With Your Consent
When we have your consent, we may disclose your personal data to others, such as select partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or services we believe you may be interested in. For example, people who receive P&G emails from our diaper brands such as Pampers® may also consent to hear about baby formulas from other companies.
Online Platforms and Ad Tech Companies
Our websites and applications may make available contact information, unique identifiers, inferred and derived information, online and technical information and geolocation data with online platforms and ad tech companies to help us serve you relevant advertisements and offers, subject to applicable legal requirements, which may include consent and/or opt-outs.  We do not sell your personal data to marketers outside of P&G in exchange for monetary compensation. Please see the U.S. State Privacy Notice section of the privacy policy below for additional information.
Vendors
We may disclose or otherwise make available your personal data to our vendors (including “service providers” and “processors” defined under applicable laws, which we collectively refer to as “service providers” or “vendors” herein) who help us run our business. This includes hosting our sites, processing payment information for the purchases made by you through our sites, delivering our emails and marketing communications to you, analyzing the data we collect, helping us with sales attribution (e.g., to see if we showed you an ad on a platform site and then you bought a product from us) and sending you the products and services you requested. We also disclose or otherwise make available your personal data with lawyers, auditors, consultants, information technology and security firms, and others who provide services to us. We disclose or otherwise make available only the personal data needed for these companies to complete the tasks we request or, where permitted by applicable law, use the personal data for certain internal purposes such as security or fraud detection. We instruct our service providers to appropriately process and protect your personal data.
Payments for Purchases
Payments for purchases made through some of our sites are completed using a third-party vendor’s online payment system.  For these sites, P&G does not have access to your credit card information provided for purchases and does not store or disclose your credit card information as part of your purchases through these third-party systems. The personal or financial information you provide to our online payment system on these sites is subject to the third-party’s privacy policy and terms of use and we recommend you review these policies before providing any personal or financial information.
Legal and Similar Reasons
If a brand or one of our businesses that controls your personal data, or some or all of its business assets, are sold to another company, your personal data will be disclosed to that company. We may also disclose your information to companies who help us protect our rights and property, or when required by law, legal processes, government authorities or as reasonably necessary to protect the rights or interests of ourselves or others.

We respect your personal data and take steps to protect it from loss, misuse, or alteration. Where appropriate, these steps can include technical measures like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, unique and complex passwords, and encryption. We also use organizational and physical measures such as training staff on data processing obligations, identification of data incidents and risks, restricting staff access to your personal information, and ensuring physical security including appropriately securing documents when not being used.
International Transfers
P&G has its head offices in the United States, regional offices in Singapore, Dubai, Geneva and Panama and further P&G service centers in other countries, like Costa Rica or Philippines. As a multinational company, P&G undertakes data transfers, either within the P&G group of entities, or when sharing your data with service providers or selected partners that may store, process, or access your data in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. Personal data collected from Quebec, for example, may be transferred outside of Canada with adequate protections and safeguards in place.
As far as EU citizens are concerned, (but also citizens of Switzerland, UK and Serbia for example) this means that their data may be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), either in countries that have been recognized by the European Commission to offer adequate data protection, like the United Kingdom (from where, for example, some of our fulfillment, return and contact center services are managed for the EU region), or Switzerland (where our EU headquarters are located), or in other countries that are not deemed, by the European Commission, as offering such level of data protection. For such transfers of data, because special safeguards need to be foreseen to ensure that the protection travels with the data, we use the EU Standard Contractual Clauses, standardized and pre-approved model data protection clauses. You can find the latest version of the approved EU Standard Contractual Clauses, including the different transfer modules, here. Our transfer agreements also incorporate the standard data protection clauses issued in accordance with UK, Swiss and Serbian data protection law If you have any questions with reference to our data transfer agreements, please contact us.
If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland, please note that P&G is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) [collectively, the “Data Privacy Framework”] developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission and Information Commissioner and Swiss Federal Data Protection, respectively, regarding the transfer of personal information from the EEA, United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) or Switzerland to the U.S., Click here to view our Data Privacy Framework: Consumer Privacy Policy.
For non-EEA and UK data, we perform such transfers based on your consent, or on our contracts, where so required by local law.

As described in further detail below, subject to meeting the requirements for a Verifiable Consumer Request (defined below), we provide Consumers – which are, for clarity, residents of certain states – the privacy rights described in this section. For residents of states without Consumer privacy rights, we will consider requests but will apply our discretion in how we process such requests. For states that have passed consumer privacy laws, but are not yet in effect, we will also consider applying state law rights prior to the effective date of such laws but will do so in our discretion.
Making a Request and Scope of Requests
As permitted by the U.S. Privacy Laws, certain requests you submit to us are subject to an identity verification process (“Verifiable Consumer Request”) as described below in the “Verifying Your Request” section below. We will not fulfill such requests unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal information.
To make a request, please submit your request to us by one of the methods below. For further instructions on how to submit a Do Not Sell/Share/Target request, for non-cookie PI (as defined below), please go to the “
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
” section below.
Calling us at (877) 701-0404 
Visiting our Preference Center (which can be reached by the “Your Privacy Choices” link in the footer of our websites or via the Settings menu in our mobile applications)
Some personal data we maintain about you is not sufficiently associated with enough of your other personal data for us to be able to verify that it is your particular personal data (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID). We do not include that personal data in response to those requests. If we deny a verified request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required to create a password-protected account with us to make a Verifiable Consumer Request. We will use personal data provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or authority to make the request and to track and document request responses unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.
We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify personal data that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your privacy requests. We will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests; provided, however, we may refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome. If we determine that we may refuse a request, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.
Verifying Your Request
To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal data or considering your deletion request. Upon receipt of your request, we will send you a verification form by email or postal mail. To complete your request, please respond to the verification form when you receive it. To verify your identity, we may require you to provide any of the following information: Name, email address, postal address, or date of birth.
We will review the information provided as part of your request and may ask you to provide additional information via e-mail or other means as part of this verification process. We will not fulfill your Right to Know (Categories), Right to Know (Specific Pieces/Portability), Right to Delete, or Right to Correction request unless you have provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify you are the Consumer about whom we collected personal data. The same verification process does not apply to opt-outs of Sale or Sharing, or limitation of sensitive personal data or special category data requests, but we may apply some verification measures if we suspect fraud.
The verification standards we are required to apply for each type of request vary. We verify your categories requests and certain deletion and correction requests (e.g., those that are less sensitive in nature) to a reasonable degree of certainty, which may include matching at least two data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you. For certain deletion and correction requests (such as those that relate to personal data that is more sensitive in nature) and for specific pieces requests, we apply a verification standard of reasonably high degree of certainty. This standard includes matching at least three data points provided by you with data points maintained by us, which we have determined to be reliable for the purpose of verifying you, and may include obtaining a signed declaration from you, under penalty of perjury, that you are the individual whose personal data is the subject of the request.
If we cannot verify you in respect of certain requests, such as if you do not provide the requested information, we will still take certain actions as required by certain U.S. Privacy Laws. For example:
If we cannot verify your deletion request, we will refer you to this U.S. State Privacy Notice for a general description of our data practices.
If we cannot verify your specific pieces request, we will treat it as a categories request.
Authorizing an Agent
You may designate an authorized agent to submit a request on your behalf by submitting a request in the manners described above. If you are an authorized agent who would like to make a request, the U.S. Privacy Laws require that we ensure that a request made by an agent is a Verifiable Consumer Request (except Do Not Sell/Share requests) and allow us to request further information to ensure that the Consumer has authorized you to make the request on their behalf. Generally, we will request that an agent provide proof that the Consumer gave the agent signed permission to submit the request, and, as permitted under the U.S. Privacy Laws, we also may require the Consumer to either verify their own identity or directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request. To make a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a Consumer, click here.
Appeal Rights
You may appeal a denial of your request by clicking here.
Right to Know/Access
Right to Know–- Categories Request
You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, the following information about the personal information we have collected about you during the past 12 months:
the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which we collected the personal information;
the business or commercial purposes for which we collected or sold the personal information;
the categories of third parties to whom we sold or shared the personal information, by category or categories of personal information for each category of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or shared;
the categories of personal information about you that we disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of persons to whom disclosed that information for a business purpose.
Right to Know–- Specific Pieces
You have the right to request a transportable copy of the specific pieces of personal data we collected about you in the 12-month period preceding your request. Please note that personal data is retained by us for various time periods, so there may be certain information that we have collected about you that we do not even retain for 12 months (and thus, it would not be able to be included in our response to you). Please also note that you may be limited under your applicable state’s law to making a certain number of “right to know” requests in any 12-month period.
Right to Delete
In addition, you have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you. Please understand that P&G cannot delete personal data in those situations where our retention is required for our own internal business purposes or otherwise permitted by relevant U.S. Privacy Laws (such as fraud prevention or legal compliance). In these situations, we will retain your personal data in accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at the end of the retention period.
Right to Correct
You have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies that you find in your personal data maintained by us. Your request to correct is subject to our verification (discussed above) and the response standards in the applicable U.S. Privacy Laws.
Right to Limit Sensitive Personal Data Processing
Certain personal data qualifies as “sensitive personal data” or “sensitive personal information” or “special category data” under U.S. Privacy Laws, which we refer to in this U.S. State Privacy Notice as “sensitive personal data or special category data”. Some U.S Privacy Laws require consent for the processing of sensitive personal data or special category data, which can be revoked, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions (for example, if the processing of your sensitive personal data or special category data is required to provide a product or service specifically requested by you). Depending on your state of residence, you have the right to revoke such consent, if applicable, and/or direct businesses to limit their use and disclosure of sensitive personal data or special category data if they use or disclose it beyond certain internal business purposes. You can make a request using the methods set forth above.
Rights as to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling
You have the right to opt-out of profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects. However, as discussed
above
, we do not carry out profiling or automated decision-making activities in a manner that requires us to provide opt-out rights.
Do Not Sell/Share/Target
Under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, Consumers have the right to opt-out of certain processing activities. Some states have opt-outs specific to Targeted Advertising activities - which California’s law refers to as “cross-context behavioral advertising”, and others simply as Targeted Advertising - which involve the use of personal data from different businesses or services to target advertisements to you. California provides Consumers the right to opt-out of Sharing, which includes providing or making available personal information to third parties for such Targeted Advertising activities, while other states provide Consumers the right to opt-out from processing personal information for Targeted Advertising more broadly. There are broad and differing concepts of the Sale of personal data under the various U.S. Privacy Laws, all of which at a minimum require providing or otherwise making available personal data to a third party.
When you provide us personal data for the below Processing Purposes, we may use some or all of that personal data to advertise to you. This may include making available your personal data collected during these Processing Purposes to third parties in way that may constitute a Sale and/or Sharing, as well as using your personal data for purposes of Targeted Advertising.
•
Products/Services.
•
Customer Management.
•
Customer Service/Communications,
•
Serving Ads.
•
Ads Administration,
• Purposes Disclosed at Collection
Third-Party digital businesses, including online platforms (Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) and AdTech companies such as Demand Side Platforms which help us place advertisements (“Third-Party Digital Businesses”) may associate cookies and other tracking technologies that collect personal data about you on our apps and websites, or otherwise collect and process personal data that we make available about you, including digital activity information. Giving access to personal data on our websites or apps, or otherwise, to Third-Party Digital Businesses could be deemed a Sale and/or Sharing and could implicate processing for purposes of Targeted Advertising under some U.S. Privacy Laws. Therefore, we will treat such personal data collected by Third-Party Digital Businesses (e.g., cookie ID, IP address, and other online IDs and internet or other electronic activity information) as such, and subject to the opt-out requests described above. In some instances, the personal data we make available about you is collected directly by such Third-Party Digital Businesses using Tracking Technologies on our websites or apps, or our advertisements that are served on third-party sites (which we refer to as “cookie PI”). However, certain personal data which we make available to Third Party Digital Businesses is information that we have previously collected directly from you or otherwise about you, such as your email address (which we refer to below as “non-cookie PI”).
When you opt-out pursuant to the instructions below, it will have the effect of opting you out of Sale, Sharing, and Targeted Advertising, such that our opt-out process is intended to combine all of these state opt-outs into a single opt-out. Instructions for opting out are below. Please note that there are distinct instructions for opting out of cookie PI and non-cookie PI, which we explain further, below.
Opt-out for non-cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your non-cookie PI (e.g., your email address) for Targeted Advertising, or opt-out of the Sale or Sharing of such data, make an opt-out request here.
Opt-out for cookie PI: If you would like to submit a request to opt-out of our processing of your cookie PI for Targeted Advertising or opt-out of the Sale/Sharing of such personal data, you need to exercise a separate opt-out request on our cookie management tool. To do so, click “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information / Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising” in the footer of each of our websites and/or in the Settings menu of each of our mobile applications.  Then follow the instructions for the toggle. This is because we have to use different technologies to apply your opt-outs of cookie PI and of non-cookie PI. Our cookie management tool enables you to exercise such an opt-out request and enable certain cookie preferences on your device.
You must exercise your preferences separately on each of our websites that you visit, within each of our mobile applications that you use, if you use a different browser than the one on which you originally opted out, and on each device that you use. Since your browser opt-out is designated by a cookie, if you clear or block cookies, your preferences will no longer be affective, and you will need to enable them again via our cookie management tool.
For more information about how we have shared your personal data with third parties such that it constitutes a “Sale” or “Share” under CCPA during the 12-month period prior to the date this privacy policy was last updated, please refer to the chart above. We do not knowingly Sell or Share personal data of minors older than 13 years of age and under 16 years of age without their consent.
Global Privacy Control (“GPC”)
Some of the U.S. Privacy Laws require businesses to process GPC signals, which is referred to in some states as opt-out preference signals and in other states as universal opt-out mechanisms. GPC is a signal sent by a platform, technology, or mechanism, enabled by individuals on their devices or browsers, that communicate the individual’s choice to opt-out of the Sale and Sharing of personal data, or of processing of personal data for Targeted Advertising. To use GPC, you can download an internet browser or a plugin to use on your current internet browser and follow the settings to enable the GPC. We have configured the settings of our consent management platform to receive and process GPC signals on our website and mobile applications, which is explained by our consent management platform here.
Certain of the U.S. Privacy Laws require us to explain how we process GPC signals in detail, specifically how we apply GPC signals and the corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests to online data (what we refer to above as “cookie PI”) and offline data (what we refer to above as “non-cookie PI”). Below we explain the scenarios in which we apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target requests communicated by GPC signals to cookie PI and, where applicable, to non-cookie PI:
• When you are visiting our website on a particular internet browser (“browser 1”), we will apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target to cookie PI collected on that browser 1.
• When you log in on browser 1: We will be able to apply the GPC signal and corresponding Do Not Sell/Share/Target request to non-cookie PI associated with your user account, but only if and after you have logged into your user account on browser 1.
When you visit our website on a different browser (“browser 2""). If you later visit our website on browser 2 (whether on the same device or a different device) and GPC is not enabled, we are unable to apply the prior GPC signal from browser 1 to cookie PI on browser 2, unless and until you login to your user account on browser 2. We will continue to apply the Do Not Sell/Share/Target opt-outs communicated via the GPC signal on browser 1.
We process GPC signals in a frictionless manner, which means that we do not: (1) charge a fee for use of our service if you have enabled GPC; (2) change your experience with our website if you use GPC; or (3) display a notification, pop-up, text, graphic, animation, sound, video, or any interstitial in response to the GPC.
Incentive and Loyalty Programs; Right to Non-Discrimination
Loyalty/Incentive Programs Notice
We also collect and use your personal data to administer and maintain Rewards Programs (defined above in “
How We Gather & Use Personal Data
”), which may be considered a “financial incentive” or a “bona fide loyalty program” under one or more of the U.S. Privacy Laws.
We use all categories of personal data disclosed in the above table, excluding “biometric information,” “professional or employment information, and “non-public education records,” to administer and maintain such Rewards Programs. All categories of personal data we use for loyalty programs may also be Sold or processed for Targeted Advertising. We may also use, Sell, and process for Targeted Advertising the categories of sensitive personal data or special category data: account information and credentials, precise geolocation data, racial or ethnic origin, and personal data concerning health. While we may collect sensitive personal data or special category data in relation to some Rewards Programs, the collection and processing of sensitive personal data or special category data is not required to participate in Rewards Programs. We use personal data to verify your identity, offer unique rewards, track your program status, and to facilitate the exchange of program points for products, promotional materials, training workshops, and other items. The categories of third parties that will receive personal data and sensitive personal data or special category data are set forth in the table above, some of which may qualify as data brokers under some of the U.S. Privacy Laws. Some U.S. Privacy Laws require us to state whether we provide Rewards Programs benefits through third-party partners; however, while we sometimes will provide you the opportunity to independently engage with third parties through our websites or apps, third parties do not provide Rewards Programs on our behalf.
You can opt-in to a Rewards Program by signing up on the applicable rewards page. If you opt-in to participate in any of our Rewards Programs, you may withdraw from participation at any time by contacting us using the contact details in this Privacy Policy or in accordance with the instructions set forth in the applicable Rewards Program’s terms and conditions.
Under certain U.S. Privacy Laws, you may be entitled to be informed as to why financial incentive programs, or price or service differences, are permitted under the law, including (i) a good-faith estimate of the value of your personal data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference, and (ii) a description of the method we used to calculate the value of your personal data. Generally, we do not assign monetary or other value to personal data. However, in the event we are required by law to assign such value in the context of Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, we have valued the personal data collected and used as being equal to the value of the discount or benefit provided, and the calculation of the value is based upon a practical and good-faith effort often involving the (i) categories of personal data collected (e.g., names, email addresses), (ii) the use of such personal data for our marketing and business purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Rewards Programs, (iii) the discounted price offered (if any), (iv) the volume of consumers enrolled in our Rewards Programs, and (v) the product or service to which the Rewards Programs, or price or service differences, applies. The disclosure of the value described herein is not intended to waive, nor should be interpreted as a waiver to, our proprietary or business confidential information, including trade secrets, and does not constitute any representation with regard to generally accepted accounting principles or financial accounting standards. We deem the value of the personal data to be reasonably related to the value of the rewards, and by subscribing to these Rewards Programs you indicate you agree. If you do not, do not subscribe to the Rewards Programs.
Non-Discrimination
You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of your privacy rights described in this U.S. State Privacy Notice. We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level or quality of goods or services in a manner that is prohibited by the U.S. Privacy Laws if you choose to exercise your rights. Please note, however, that you will no longer be able to participate in Rewards Programs request to delete personal data. This is because we need the personal data collected in relation Rewards Program to carry out the functions described above.

To do so contact us at 1 Procter & Gamble Plaza, Cincinnati, OH 45202, U.S.A. (Attn: Privacy). You must put the statement “Shine the Light Request” in the body of your correspondence.

We will not accept Shine the Light requests by telephone or by fax, and are not responsible for requests not labeled or sent properly, or that are incomplete.

Applicable Law and Disputes
To the extent permitted by law, the Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in all respects in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Ohio, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST P&G (INCLUDING ANY P&G BRAND) ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY LITIGATION OR OTHER ACTION OR PROCEEDING WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
There might be an occasion in which you and P&G (including any P&G Brand) are subject to a Dispute (as defined below) that directly or indirectly arises out of, or relates, to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand). In the event of such a Dispute, you agree (i) to comply with the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process as set forth below, and, (ii) that, if the Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process does not resolve the Dispute, then you will comply with the Formal Dispute Resolution Process.
Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process
For any Dispute that arises between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) concerning or otherwise related to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand), you agree that you will first make a good faith effort to resolve such a Dispute informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, as set forth below.
This informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent and prerequisite to commencing legal action against P&G (including any P&G brand). This informal dispute resolution process requires that you send a written description of the Dispute, including the nature and basis of the claim and the nature and basis of the specific relief sought (with a calculation for it), to the other party that also includes contact information (name, address, email, phone number, and, if applicable, account number, purchase order numbers, and transaction confirmation codes) (the “Notice”). For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send this Notice, along with this contact information and other data sufficient for us to identify your transaction, account, or other relevant information with us at the following: The Procter & Gamble Company, C T Corporation System 4400 Easton Commons Way Suite 125 Columbus, Ohio 43219. You must personally sign the Notice (along with an attorney if you are represented) that is mailed to us.
After the Notice of your intent to engage in the informal dispute resolution process is transmitted and received by us, in accordance with the aforementioned instructions, each party hereby agrees to promptly negotiate in good faith about the Dispute. This process should lead to resolution of the Dispute, but if the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the fully completed Notice of the informal dispute, each party agrees to the Formal Dispute Resolution Process set forth below. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fee or other deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. A court shall have the authority to enforce the terms of this mandatory informal dispute resolution process.
Formal Dispute Resolution Process
Any Dispute between you and P&G (including between you and any P&G Brand) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to these Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G (including from a P&G Brand) that cannot be resolved through the aforementioned informal dispute resolution process shall be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Hamilton County, Ohio. You hereby irrevocably consent to such venue and to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court over any such dispute. YOU FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND P&G (INCLUDING BETWEEN YOU AND ANY P&G BRAND) CONCERNING OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THESE TERMS, A P&G WEBSITE, OR YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF A PRODUCT, GOOD, OR SERVICE FROM P&G (INCLUDING A P&G BRAND).
Miscellaneous
Any cause of action or claim you may have directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Terms, a P&G Website, or your purchase or use of a product, good, or service from P&G must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.
The Privacy Statement provides separate options for individuals to lodge complaints in relation to the Privacy Statement and their personal information.
These dispute resolution processes do not limit your obligations to comply with any other provisions or requirements in these Terms, including the “Notices And Procedures For Making Claims Of Copyright Infringement”.
Terms
For purposes of these Terms, the term “Dispute” shall be interpreted as broadly as permitted under the law and shall cover any claim or controversy, related to P&G or our relationship with you, including but not limited to, any and all: (i) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise; (ii) claims that arose before these Terms; (iii) claims that arise after the termination of these Terms; and (iv) claims that are the subject of purported class action litigation.
Back to Top
No Waiver
No failure on the part of P&G to enforce any part of the Terms shall constitute a waiver of any of P&G’s rights under the Terms whether for part or future actions on the part of any person. Neither the receipt of any funds by P&G nor the reliance of any person on P&G’s actions shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any part of the Terms. Only a specific, written waiver signed by an authorized representative of P&G shall have any legal effect whatsoever.

P&G: Building a Water Positive Future

We want to help build a #WaterPositiveFuture that can sustain people and nature now — and for generations to come. By 2030, we’ll restore more water than is consumed from P&G manufacturing sites in 18 water-stressed areas. And in metro areas of Mexico City and LA 📍 we’re also committed to restoring more water than is consumed during use of our products, recognized as a first-of-its-kind goal. We will advance this strategy through product innovation, on-the-ground action in water-stressed areas, and our leadership of the @50LHome Coalition.

About us
              P&G was founded more than 185 years ago as a soap and candle company. Today, we’re one of the world’s largest consumer goods companies and home to iconic, trusted brands, including Always®, Charmin®, Braun®, Fairy®, Febreze®, Gillette®, Head & Shoulders®, Oral B®, Pantene®, Pampers®, Tide®, and Vicks®. 
 
The design, development, growth and success of these products—and many more—is thanks to the innovative and insightful minds of our people. From Day 1, you’ll help make everyday life easier for our 5 billion consumers. 
 
There is no single equation for success at P&G, because no two P&G people or careers are alike. Just as we strive to deliver a superior consumer experience, we aim to deliver a superior employee value equation as well. With our large global footprint, there are many opportunities to work with P&G in multiple locations. We offer opportunities in approximately 70 countries and continually aim to attract, reward and advance the finest people in the world. 
 
Here, we want you to get your career off to a fast start. That's why we don't have any rotational development programs or gradual ramping-up periods: you’ll be able—and encouraged—to dive right in from Day 1. Join us and help make life better through meaningful work that makes an impact from Day 1.

P&G’s Consumer Health Data Privacy Policy
Effective March 1, 2024
The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”, “P&G Co”, “We”) is committed to respecting your privacy. Our Global Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal data generally.

Consumer Health Data does not include information pertaining to individuals with whom we have an employment relationship.

For cookie-related Consumer Health Data, you can do this by visiting your “Cookie Preferences” in the bottom right corner of our health-related websites or in the Settings menu of our mobile applications. Withdrawing your consent for collection of non-cookie related Consumer Health Data will effectuate a deletion request.

To exercise these rights, please visit our Consumer Health Data Preference Center.  We will authenticate your requests and process it as required by law. Please allow up to 45 days for a response.
