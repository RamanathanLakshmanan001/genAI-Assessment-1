Zoom is for Everyone
Accessibility is at the heart of what we do.
The Zoom difference: Communication without barriers
Zoom puts users front and center, driving inclusivity for everyone. We listen to our customers and are continually looking for ways to build the very best, most accessible communications experience.
Capabilities for all
Whether you’re a free or paid user, we have options for you
Real-time interaction
Live transcriptions, so you don’t fall behind in the conversation
Complete experience
Going beyond in-meeting support with post-meeting functionality, such as recording highlights and search
Captioning & Transcription Options
Auto-generated captions
Zoom meetings and webinars automatically provide live captioning.
Manual captions
Assign someone to type captions during the meeting.
Third-party captioning
Zoom integrates seamlessly with third-party closed captioning providers using our Closed Captioning REST API.
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Video Options
Multi-spotlight
A meeting host can spotlight the sign language interpreter so they are always in view for everyone.
Multi-pinning

Re-arrange Gallery View
Create your own view by clicking and dragging video tiles.
Case Study
Learn how our customers are leveraging Zoom’s all-in-one platform to address their communications challenges.
""Now that you have it built-in, [Live Transcription] works flawlessly. We have some hearing-impaired individuals and employees, and having closed captioning helps them out.""

*Use of the SDK Service will be measured based on the total number of meeting session minutes in a month attributable to the meeting sessions launched by Customer and/or users of Customer's application (""Meeting Session Minutes""). For example, if five (5) end users participate in a 10 minute meeting session through Customer's application, then fifty (50) total Meeting Session Minutes will be used. Partial minutes used are rounded up.
Zoom’s video calling is basically the world standard. It’s used very widely, especially during the pandemic and the Video SDK is using the same infrastructure. After implementing Zoom our users started having a more streamlined experience which also helps the overall TaskHuman brand.

Request a demo
Get started
Why automate your workflows?
The average workday is full of routine tasks that add up into hours, diminishing productivity across teams. Often teams rely on multiple collaboration apps, but need to spend manual time turning outputs from one tool into inputs for another. 
Increase productivity
Free up time for more strategic activities when your team can automate routine tasks, like organizing meeting summaries in a dedicated document and channel with the help of AI Companion.
Improve efficiency
Automate series of actions across disparate productivity and collaboration tools to happen in seconds based on conditional triggers and sequential workflows.
Simplify complexity
Our no-code experience and templates makes it easy for anyone to build complex workflows. Allowing teams to build tailored workflows helps scale up efficiency gains across the company.
Connect a variety of products
Use Workflow Automation to automate processes across Zoom services and with third party apps.
Example workflows
Zoom Workflow Automation will allow you to automate a range of helpful workflows using a handful of triggers and steps. Leverage recommended templates for common use cases.

Government
A communications platform for federal, state, and local agencies
Federal, state, and local government organizations can use Zoom or Zoom for Government to evolve public services, improve citizen engagement, and embrace digital transformation.
Get Started
Secure communications from the start
Our secure government communication platform helps protect the exchange of important government information, all with robust controls necessary for compliance.
A new kind of flexibility
Zoom’s flexible architecture is built with your workforce in mind, including strategic solutions that enable government employees to do their best work from anywhere.
Expanding citizen engagement
From video-first public safety services to increased access to justice, our dynamic government communications platform and integrations evolve the way you connect with citizens.
Zoom for Government vs. commercial Zoom
In the United States, we offer a separate platform, called Zoom for Government (ZfG), that is designed to conform with the federal government’s security requirements. While originally created for federal agencies, ZfG is also available to U.S. state and local government customers as well as other approved businesses and organizations. 
Zoom for Government delivers an intuitive and secure experience similar to commercial Zoom. Both versions of the platform are scalable and flexible, giving today’s public sector organizations what they need to achieve their goals while still helping to protect important information.

Zoom was already a preferred vendor – trusted by our procurement and security teams. We ultimately chose Zoom Revenue Accelerator for Sales for features like best-in-class transcription that we could leverage in our own product. And, of course, our sales reps were already using Zoom Meetings, so it wasn’t an additional technology to add to the stack which saved us onboarding time.

Meeting SDK
Embed the Zoom meeting and webinar experience in an app or website.
The Zoom Meeting SDK lets you display the familiar Zoom meeting and webinar experience in your app or website. The Meeting SDK interface resembles the Zoom client, except that it lives inside your own app or website.

Electron
Linux
Unreal
React Native
Enhance the users' experience
Native platforms for mobile and desktop offer a default UI, which looks similar to the Zoom client, and a custom UI, which offers the ability to completely customize the user interface.
The web SDK offers a
client view
, which looks similar to the Zoom client, and a modular
component view
, which displays the Meeting SDK in components on your website.
Meeting and webinar authorization
Each time you use the SDK to join a meeting or webinar,
generate an SDK JWT
to let you securely transmit your SDK credentials to Zoom's auth servers. Start meetings on behalf of other users using a
ZAK (Zoom Access Key) token
.
The Meeting SDK is also compatible with
Zoom OAuth
, allowing existing Zoom users to
connect their accounts to your Meeting SDK
.
Access to raw data
Direct access to raw video and audio data on native platforms enables improved interaction between users and the app video stream. Imagine a gaming video streaming app with direct interaction between the player and viewers based on in-game events or prompts from the community. Or an AR streaming platform with direct viewer access to on-screen video. Raw data is also useful for building custom live transcription, video or audio analysis, and integrates well with
Zoom Apps
.
Implementation requirements
We enforce a required minimum version of the Meeting SDK. See our
SDK minimum version policy
for details.
The Meeting SDK follows the Zoom license model. See
Zoom Meetings
,
Zoom Webinars
, and the
Zoom ISV Partner Program
for details.
The Meeting SDK uses the same global infrastructure as other Zoom products. If you experience connection issues, be sure your products follow the Zoom network firewall and proxy server settings connection requirements. See the
Zoom Connection Process
whitepaper and
Zoom network firewall or proxy server settings
for details.

To make API requests to Zoom, start by obtaining an access token through OAuth or server-to-server authentication.
Send HTTP requests to the base URL https://api.zoom.us/v2/ with your access token in the Authorization header. Use GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, or DELETE methods as needed for different endpoints. Refer to the API reference for specific endpoint details and required parameters.

Authentication
All API requests require an access token. You can get an access token by authenticating with OAuth or by using server-to-server OAuth.
For OAuth, implement the authorization flow to get user consent and receive an authorization code. Exchange this code for an access token.
For server-to-server OAuth, use your app credentials to directly request an access token. Both methods provide access tokens valid for one hour.
Use the refresh token (for OAuth) or request a new token (for server-to-server) when the current token expires.
OAuth 2.0
curl -X POST https://zoom.us/oauth/token \
     -H ""Authorization: Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENT_ID_AND_SECRET"" \
     -H ""Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" \

Subscribe to events
Zoom will send real-time notifications to your endpoint when events occur. To subscribe to events,
set up event subscriptions
in your app. Specify an HTTPS endpoint URL that can accept POST requests with JSON payloads. Enable desired event subscriptions in your app settings.
Implement verification to ensure webhook authenticity. Your endpoint should respond with a 200 or 204 status code within 3 seconds to confirm receipt.
In addition to webhooks, Zoom offers WebSockets for real-time event notifications. See the
WebSockets documentation
for details on this alternative method, currently in public beta.

Rate limits
The Zoom API uses rate limits to ensure efficient handling of API request traffic. When you exceed a rate limit, the API request will fail and return a HTTP 429 status code. Rate limits are applied at the account level and vary based on your account plan.
For full details on rate limits, see our
rate limit documentation
.

Pagination
Zoom APIs use pagination to manage large result sets. Most APIs use the next_page_token parameter for pagination. When making requests, specify the page_size to control results per page. If more results are available, use the returned next_page_token in subsequent requests.
For full details on pagination, see our
pagination documentation
.

Status and error codes
The Zoom API uses HTTP Status codes to reflect a successful or unsuccesful request. 2XX status codes represent a successful request, 4XX/5XX status codes represent an error took place. If you receive an error status code, check the body for an error code and message.

Zoom IP addresses
We strongly recommend that you
Verify webhook events
instead of creating an allow list of Zoom IP addresses because Zoom may update the
IP ranges
used at any time.
Verify webhook events
Zoom offers two ways to verify the authenticity of a webhook, to ensure developers that the request came from Zoom:
The Zoom Webhook Verification Token is deprecated. Zoom will retire it in June 2025. Use the Zoom Webhook Secret Token instead, or your own header flow for Webhook verification.
Verify with Zoom's header
Verify with your own header
Verify with Zoom's header
Zoom includes a webhook secret token on the Add Feature page for your app. Zoom uses the value of the secret token to hash the webhook data, which it sends in the x-zm-signature webhook request header.
To verify that Zoom sent a webhook request, use the webhook secret token and the webhook request body to create a signature to compare with the x-zm-signature header value sent by Zoom.
Example request headers:
{
  ""host"": ""example.com"",
  ""user-agent"": ""Zoom Marketplace/1.0a"",
  ""content-length"": ""110"",
  ""authorization"": ""Wk9PTV9BVVRIT1JJWkFUSU9O"",
  ""content-type"": ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
  ""traceparent"": ""Wk9PTV9UUkFDRVBBUkVOVA"",
  ""x-forwarded-for"": ""{X_FORWARDED_FOR}"",
  ""x-forwarded-host"": ""example.com"",
  ""x-forwarded-proto"": ""https"",
  ""x-zm-request-timestamp"": ""1739923528"",
  ""x-zm-signature"": ""v0=WF9aT09NX1NJR05BVFVSRQ"",
  ""accept-encoding"": ""gzip""
}
Create your signature string to compare with the Zoom webhook x-zm-signature header value:
Receive the webhook request.
The webhook request body includes the following properties:
Key Value Type Value Description
event string The type of the webhook event
payload object Contains the event webhook details
event_ts number The timestamp of the webhook event.
Example request body:
{
  ""event"": ""session.started"",
  ""payload"": {
    ""account_id"": ""{ACCOUNT_ID}"",
    ""object"": {
      ""start_time"": ""2022-07-27T16:56:34Z"",
      ""id"":""{SESSION_ID}""
    }
  },
  ""event_ts"": 1658940994914
}
Construct the message.
After receiving a webhook request, construct the message string with ""v0"", the webhook request header x-zm-request-timestamp value, and the webhook request body. Separate each section with a colon :. For example:
v0:{WEBHOOK_REQUEST_HEADER_X-ZM-REQUEST-TIMESTAMP_VALUE}:{WEBHOOK_REQUEST_BODY}
Example string with printed values:
v0:1658940994:{""event"":""session.started"",""payload"":{""account_id"":""{ACCOUNT_ID}"",""object"":{""start_time"":""2022-07-27T16:56:34Z"",""id"":""{SESSION_ID}""}},""event_ts"":1658940994914}
Hash the message.
Once you have constructed the message string, create a
HMAC SHA-256
hash. Set your webhook's secret token as the secret/salt, and the message you constructed as the string to hash. Output in hex format.
Create the signature.
Then, create the signature by prepending v0= to the hashed message. For example:
v0={HASHED_MESSAGE}
Example string with printed values:
v0=a05d830fa017433bc47887f835a00b9ff33d3882f22f63a2986a8es270341
Compare the signature.
Compare the signature you created with the Zoom webhook request header x-zm-signature value. If it matches, the webhook request came from Zoom.
Here is an example in Node.js:
const crypto = require('crypto')

const message = `v0:${request.headers['x-zm-request-timestamp']}:${JSON.stringify(request.body)}`

const hashForVerify = crypto.createHmac('sha256', ZOOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN).update(message).digest('hex')

const signature = `v0=${hashForVerify}`

if (request.headers['x-zm-signature'] === signature) {
  // Webhook request came from Zoom
} else {
  // Webhook request did not come from Zoom
}
See the
Webhook sample app for an example implementation
.
Learn more about
HMAC Auth for webhooks
.
Validate your webhook endpoint
Zoom requires that you manually trigger webhook validation when you add a new webhook or make changes to an existing one. Subsequently, Zoom automatically revalidates webhooks every 72 hours.
Zoom uses a challenge-response check (CRC) for webhook validation. When a CRC occurs, Zoom makes a POST request to your endpoint with a challenge request body. After your endpoint receives the request, your app needs to respond with the challenge response within 3 seconds.
To trigger the initial CRC validation, click Validate under the Event Notification Endpoint URL on the Feature page for your app. See
Revalidation
for revalidation details.
You won't be able to save your changes until after Zoom validates your endpoint.
Implement the challenge-response check flow
Receive the challenge (webhook request body).
The webhook request body includes the following properties:
Key Value Type Value Description
event string The type of the webhook event, which will be ""endpoint.url_validation""
payload object Contains a property with the plainToken value, the string to hash.
event_ts number The timestamp of the webhook event.
Example request headers:
{
  ""host"": ""example.com"",
  ""user-agent"": ""Zoom Marketplace/1.0a"",
  ""content-length"": ""110"",
  ""authorization"": ""Wk9PTV9BVVRIT1JJWkFUSU9O"",
  ""content-type"": ""application/json; charset=utf-8"",
  ""traceparent"": ""Wk9PTV9UUkFDRVBBUkVOVA"",
  ""x-forwarded-for"": ""{X_FORWARDED_FOR}"",
  ""x-forwarded-host"": ""example.com"",
  ""x-forwarded-proto"": ""https"",
  ""x-zm-request-timestamp"": ""1739923528"",
  ""x-zm-signature"": ""v0=WF9aT09NX1NJR05BVFVSRQ"",
  ""accept-encoding"": ""gzip""
}
Example request body:
{
  ""payload"": {
    ""plainToken"": ""qgg8vlvZRS6UYooatFL8Aw""
  },
  ""event_ts"": 1654503849680,
  ""event"": ""endpoint.url_validation""
}
Hash the plainToken.
Once you receive the request body, create a
HMAC SHA-256
hash. Set your webhook's secret token as the secret (salt), and the plainToken value as the string to hash. Output in hex format.
Create the response JSON object.
Create a JSON object with a key of ""plainToken"" with a value of the plainToken from the request body, and a key of ""encryptedToken"" with a value of the hashed plainToken. For example:
{
  ""plainToken"": ""qgg8vlvZRS6UYooatFL8Aw"",
  ""encryptedToken"": ""23a89b634c017e5364a1c8d9c8ea909b60dd5599e2bb04bb1558d9c3a121faa5""
}
Respond with the response JSON object.
Respond with the response JSON within 3 seconds with a 200 or 204 HTTP response code.
When Zoom successfully validates the challenge response from your webhook endpoint URL, you'll see a validated message under the Event Notification Endpoint URL. If validation fails, you'll see a failed to validate message. Once you successfully complete validation, click Save.
Here is an example in Node.js:
const crypto = require('crypto')

// Webhook request event type is a challenge-response check
if(request.body.event === 'endpoint.url_validation') {
  const hashForValidate = crypto.createHmac('sha256', ZOOM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN).update(request.body.payload.plainToken).digest('hex')

  response.status(200)
  response.json({
    ""plainToken"": request.body.payload.plainToken,
    ""encryptedToken"": hashForValidate
  })
}
See the
Webhook sample app for an example implementation
.
Revalidation
Your production and development webhook URLs will be revalidated periodically every 72 hours. Zoom will send notification emails to the account owner associated with your apps if the URL fails the revalidation, following this schedule:
First notification email after a total of 2 consecutive failed revalidations.
Second notification email after a total of 4 consecutive failed revalidations.
If the revalidation check fails 6 times in a row, Zoom will stop sending webhook events and disable the event subscription. To fix the issue to receive webhook events again, go to your apps webhook endpoint URL configuration, reenable webhooks, update your endpoint URL if needed, click validate to revalidate your endpoint URL, and finally, click save.
If you are still having trouble, see the
Webhook sample app for an example implementation
or review the
webhook endpoint URL requirements
.
Notification delivery
Your webhook endpoint URL should respond with either a 200 or a 204 HTTP status code within three seconds after receiving a webhook request in order for Zoom to consider the notification was successfully delivered.
Unsuccessful delivery
For any unsuccessful notification deliveries, Zoom attempts to deliver the webhook three times:
The first attempt is sent 5 minutes after the initial delivery attempt.
A second attempt is sent 20 minutes after the first attempt.
A third attempt is sent 60 minutes after the second attempt.
If a 200 or a 204 response is received after any retry attempt, then Zoom considers the notification was successfully delivered.
However, if Zoom does not receive a 200 or a 204 response after three attempts, then no further webhooks for that event will be sent.
If you have successfully validated your webhook endpoint, but you are not receiving certain events you have selected, toggle the webhook feature on and off and try again.
Delivery latency
The event_ts response is included in the payload of all event notifications. This represents the timestamp for when the associated event occurred.
You can determine the latency in webhook delivery by calculating the difference between the delivery timestamp and the value of the event_ts.

Zoom Technical Library
Your go-to resource for advanced technical guides, in-depth knowledge, and practical tips for all things Zoom!
Introducing the Zoom Technical Library!
The Zoom Technical Library is your destination for advanced Zoom product documentation and processes! We understand there are many settings, switches, and knobs available across our platform, and we want to support Zoom Platform Admins with the best resources we can, so we’ve created this library with systems admins and technical folks in mind. Below is a sneak peek at the types of resources you can expect to see added over time:
Solution Guides
A step-by-step tutorial for completing a specific technical goal or process within a Zoom application, like setting up a call queue with skill-based routing. You can expect to see a lot of these in the coming months.
Bluepapers
As a nod to Zoom’s favorite color, a “Bluepaper” is the more detailed and comprehensive version of a whitepaper. Bluepapers delve deeper into a Zoom product line or service, providing in-depth overviews and summaries of core topics that matter to your organization.
Field Guides
Field Guides act as navigation tools and deployment guides for Zoom products and features. Unlike Solutions Guides, which focus on how to perform specific tasks within a product, Field Guides focus on large-scale product deployments such as deploying the Zoom Phone Local Survivability Module. In these documents, you can expect step-by-step instructions, tips, and best practices to enhance and simplify your organization’s deployment experience.
Explainers
These easy-to-scan documents are designed to simplify Zoom's products and help you understand concepts faster by blending elements of an FAQ and a whitepaper. Products are broken down into technical concepts with concise summaries in the headers and detailed explanations in the body, enabling you to skim the document header-to-header for a quick understanding.
The Library currently focuses on Zoom Contact Center content, and our goal is to expand the library to cover additional Zoom products in the near future. So, whether you're a seasoned Zoom admin or just getting started, there will be something for everyone here. Feel free to bookmark the page and stay tuned for updates as we expand our offerings and grow into this space!

How to change your Zoom Background
It’s easy to change your virtual background to an image - or even a video. Follow the steps below to get started. Pro tip: Update to the latest version of Zoom to see all options and filters.
Download an image or video of your choosing.
  Compatible formats include GIF, JPG/JPEG, or PNG. We recommend an image with a 16:9 aspect ratio, and a minimum resolution of 1280x720 pixels.

Videos should be MP4 or MOV files with a minimum resolution of 480x360 pixels (360p) and a maximum resolution of 1920x1020 (1080p).
On the desktop app, navigate to Preferences in the settings menu. On the left side menu, go to Background & Filters.
You will then see Virtual Backgrounds, where you can choose from the preloaded options, or upload your own by clicking the plus (+) icon to the right of Video Filters.

You can choose either an image or a video as your background. You’ll see a library of the images and videos you’ve uploaded under Virtual Backgrounds.
To add or change your virtual background during a meeting, click on the upward arrow (^) next to Start/Stop Video. Click Choose Virtual Background, and select any of your backgrounds!
Top 3 tips for best Zoom Virtual Background results:
Tip 1
Leave “Mirror my video” checked. Words in your background will look backwards to you, but will read normally to the other meeting participants.
Tip 2
For the cleanest results, have a solid color in the background - or better yet, a green screen - so that your virtual background shows up clearly.
Tip 3
Don’t wear clothing the same color as your virtual background. No one wants to be a floating head!
Add some fun to calls with filters and stickers
Set the mood or add levity to calls with filters or stickers. You can access both from either the desktop app, or from within a meeting.
In the desktop app:
Go to Preferences > Background & Filters
You’ll see Virtual Backgrounds and Video Filters. Click on Video Filters
Within Video Filters, you can preview the filters, sticker backgrounds, or stickers that move with you, like a graduation cap, sunglasses, or even transform yourself into a unicorn!
You can also add filters and stickers during a meeting. Click on the upward arrow (^) next to Start/Stop Video. Click Choose Video Filter, and try out a new look.
Touch up your appearance and adjust for low light
If you don’t have the best lighting, or just want to brighten up your appearance, you’ll want to know about the touch up your appearance and lowlight settings.
To access both of these features from the desktop app, follow these simple steps:
Go to Preferences > Settings
  Click Video in the left side navigation
Under My Video you’ll see check boxes for both Touch up my appearance and Adjust for low light. Both features will automatically adjust your video, but you can also manually adjust them using the slider
To touch up your appearance or lighting during a meeting, click on the upward arrow (^) next to Start/Stop Video. Click Video Settings, and easily adjust your video on the fly.
