We achieved strong order intake across all businesses in 2024, with a book-to-bill well above 1, confirming the solid demand for our products and services. We delivered on our 2024 guidance in what was a testing year for Airbus. We refocused our efforts on key priorities, notably the production ramp-up and the transformation of Defence and Space. We continue to pursue profitable growth and our decarbonisation ambition. The 2024 financial results and the level of confidence we have in our future performance support our proposal for an increased dividend.

Innovating the future of aviation
The legacy of Airbus is one of cutting-edge engineering and innovation that stretches back more than 50 years. For all the greatest European aerospace milestones – from the first flight of the Concorde in 1969 to the launch of the JUICE spacecraft in 2023 – Airbus or its predecessor companies played key roles.
Today, we are innovating the future of flight, designing novel technologies that will make the next generation of aircraft the lightest, safest and most sustainable yet.

Board and Board Committees
Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors
Under the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors is responsible for the management of the Company and consists of a maximum of 12 members, appointed and removed at the Shareholders’ Meeting. The Board is charged with the overall conduct of the Company, the management, direction and performance of the Company and its business.
The Board Rules specify that in addition to the Board of Directors’ responsibilities under applicable law and the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors is responsible for certain enumerated categories of decisions.
Under the Board Rules, the Board of Directors delegates the day-to-day management of the Company to the CEO, who, supported by the Executive Committee, makes decisions with respect to the management of the Company. However, the CEO may not enter into transactions that form part of the key responsibilities of the Board of Directors unless these transactions have been approved by the Board of Directors.
Members of the Board of Directors
(As of 10 April 2024)
René Obermann Chairman of the Board of Directors of Airbus SE 
Guillaume Faury Chief Executive Officer of Airbus SE
Victor Chu Non-Executive Director
Jean-Pierre Clamadieu Non-Executive Director
Mark Dunkerley Non-Executive Director

Dr Feiyu Xu Non-Executive Director
 The Board Committees
Three Board Committees exist:
The Audit Committee makes recommendations on the approval of the annual financial statements and the quarterly and half-year accounts, supports the Board in the appointment of external auditors and ensures that audit activities are correctly directed.
The Remuneration, Nomination and Governance Committee makes recommendations to the Board for major appointments within the Company, for example in the Executive Committee, for remuneration strategies and long-term remuneration plans and also performs regular evaluations of the Company´s corporate governance.
The Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee assists the Board in overseeing Airbus’ culture and commitment to ethical business, integrity and sustainability. It oversees the Company's ethics and compliance programme, organisation and framework for the effective governance of ethics and compliance, including all associated internal policies, procedures and controls. It also oversees Airbus' sustainability strategy and effective governance and ensures that sustainability related topics are taken into account in the Company's objectives and strategy.
The Audit Committee
Pursuant to the Board Rules, the Audit Committee, which is required to meet at least four times a year, makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on the approval of the annual financial statements (FY) and the interim (Q1, H1, Q3) accounts, as well as the appointment of external auditors and the determination of their remuneration.
Moreover, the Audit Committee has the responsibility for verifying and making recommendations to the effect that the internal and external audit activities are correctly directed, that internal controls are duly exercised and that these matters are given due importance at the meetings of the Board of Directors. Thus, it discusses with the auditors their audit programme and the results of the audit of the accounts and it monitors the adequacy of Airbus’ internal controls, accounting policies and financial reporting. It also oversees the operation of Airbus’ Enterprise Risk Management system and the Compliance Organisation.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are invited to attend meetings of the Audit Committee. The Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Controlling and Accounting are requested to attend meetings to present management proposals and to answer questions. Furthermore, the Head of Corporate Audit and the Chief Compliance Officer are requested to report to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
Members of the Audit Committee
(As of 10 April 2024)
Catherine Guillouard Chair, independent
Mark Dunkerley Member, independent
Stephan Gemkow Member, independent
Antony Wood Member, independent
Dr Feiyu Xu Member, independent
The RNG Committee
Pursuant to the Board Rules, the RNGC, which is required to meet at least four times a year, consults with the CEO with respect to proposals for the appointment of the members of the Executive Committee and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the appointment of the Secretary to the Board of Directors.
The RNGC also makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding succession planning at Board, Executive Committee and Senior Management levels, remuneration strategies and long-term remuneration plans. Furthermore, the Committee decides on the service contracts and other contractual matters in relation to the Members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. 
In addition, the RNGC reviews top talents, discusses measures to improve engagement and to promote diversity, reviews the remuneration of the Executive Committee members, the Long Term Incentive Plans (LTIP), and the variable pay.
Finally, the RNGC performs regular evaluations of the Company’s corporate governance and makes proposals for changes to the Board Rules or the Articles of Association.

The guiding principle governing management appointments within Airbus is that the best candidate should be appointed to the position (“best person for the job”), while at the same time seeking to achieve a balanced composition with respect to gender, experience, national origin etc. The implementation of these principles should, however, not create any restrictions on the diversity within the Company’s executive management team.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are invited to attend meetings of the RNGC. The Chief Human Resources Officer Airbus is requested to attend meetings to present management proposals and to answer questions.
Members of the RNG Committee
(As of 10 April 2024)
Amparo Moraleda Chair, independent
Jean-Pierre Clamadieu Member, independent
Mark Dunkerley Member, independent
Claudia Nemat Member, independent
The Ethics, Compliance & Sustainability Committee
Pursuant to the Board Rules, the Ethics, Compliance and Sustainability Committee has as its main mission to assist the Board in overseeing Airbus’ culture and commitment to ethical business, integrity and sustainability. It is required to meet at least four times a year. At least twice a year, the Committee dedicates one of its agenda items to sustainability topics.
It also monitors Airbus’ ethics and compliance programme, organisation and framework for the effective governance of ethics and compliance matters, including all associated internal policies, procedures and controls, which include the areas of money laundering and terrorist financing, fraud, bribery and corruption, trade sanctions and export control, data privacy, procurement and supply chain compliance and anti-competitive practices. It also oversees Airbus' sustainability strategy and effective governance and ensures that sustainability related topics are taken into account in the Company's objectives and strategy.

Shareholders' Meeting
Annual General Meetings
Airbus holds Annual General Meetings to inform shareholders and elect the Board of Directors. Shareholders and partners can ask questions about previous and future business activities and receive detailed information on the Company’s finances. The Board of Directors manages and controls Airbus.
The 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on Tuesday 15 April 2025 at 1:30 pm.
Click below for detailed information of this Annual General Meeting.

Shareholders' meetings at a glance
If you would like to know where the Annual General Meetings or other extraordinary Shareholder Meetings of Airbus are held, or how you can register to attend and vote, our overview provides answers to the most frequently asked questions about our Shareholders’ Meetings.
How often are Shareholders’ Meetings held?
Shareholders’ Meetings are held as often as the Board of Directors deems necessary or upon the request of shareholders who are holding, individually or together, at least 10% of the total issued share capital of the Company. The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company is held within six months of the end of the financial year.
The Board of Directors must give notice of Annual General Meetings at least 42 days before the day of the meeting through publication of a notice on the Company’s website, which will be directly and permanently accessible until the meeting. The convening notice must state the items as set out under section 2:114, paragraph 1 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Where do Shareholders’ Meetings take place?
Shareholders’ Meetings are held in Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam or Haarlemmermeer (Schiphol Airport) in the Netherlands. The Board of Directors may decide that Shareholders’ Meetings may be attended by means of electronic or video communication devices from the locations mentioned in the convening notice.
When does the Board of Directors announce the Annual General Meeting?
The Board of Directors must announce the date of the Annual General Meeting at least 10 weeks in advance.
How can shareholders put items on the agenda?
Requests made by one or more shareholders collectively representing at least 3% of the issued share capital to put items on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting must be effected by the Board of Directors, if such requests to the Board of Directors have been made at least eight weeks prior to the date scheduled for the meeting and unless reasonableness and fairness require otherwise.
A request as referred to in the preceding paragraph may only be made in writing. The Board of Directors can decide that “in writing” is understood to include a request that is recorded electronically.
Who can attend Shareholders’ Meetings?
Each holder of one or more shares may attend Shareholders’ Meetings, either in person or by written proxy, speak and vote according to the Articles of Association. A shareholder, or another person who has the right to attend a meeting, can see to it that he or she is represented by more than one proxy holder, provided that only one proxy holder can be appointed for each share.
How to register for Shareholders’ Meetings?
The persons who have the right to attend and vote at Shareholders’ Meetings are those who are on record in a register designated for that purpose by the Board of Directors on the 28th day prior to the day of the Shareholders’ Meeting (the “Registration Date”), irrespective of who may be entitled to the shares at the time of that meeting.
Any person entitled to exercise the rights set out in the above paragraph (either in person or by means of a written proxy) and is attending the meeting from another location in such a manner that the person acting as Chairman of the meeting is convinced that such a person is properly participating in the meeting, shall be deemed to be present or represented at the meeting and shall be entitled to vote and be counted towards a quorum accordingly.
As a prerequisite to attending the Shareholders’ Meeting and to casting votes, the Company, or alternatively an entity or person so designated by the Company, should be notified in writing by each holder of one or more shares (and those who derive the aforementioned rights from these shares), not earlier than the Registration Date of the intention to attend the meeting. Ultimately, this notice must be received by the Company, or alternatively an entity or person so designated by the Company, on the day mentioned in the convening notice.
What about shareholders holding their shares through Euroclear France S.A.?
Shareholders holding their Airbus shares through Euroclear France S.A. who wish to attend Shareholders’ Meetings will have to request from their financial intermediary or account holder an admission card and be given a proxy to this effect from Euroclear France S.A. in accordance with the instructions specified by the Company in the convening notice. For this purpose, a shareholder will also be able to request that it be registered directly (and not through Euroclear France S.A.) in the register of the Company. However, only shares registered in the name of Euroclear France S.A. may be traded on stock exchanges.
In order to exercise their voting rights, the shareholders will also be able, by contacting their financial intermediary or account holder, to give their voting instructions to Euroclear France S.A. or any other person designated for this purpose, as specified by the Company in the convening notice.
Are there any electronic means of attendance?
In accordance with its Articles of Association, Airbus may provide for electronic means of attendance, speaking and voting at the Shareholders’ Meetings. The use of such electronic means will depend on the availability of the necessary technical means and market practice.
Which majority or quorum is necessary to adopt a resolution?
All resolutions are adopted by means of a simple majority of the votes cast, except when a qualified majority is prescribed by the Articles of Association or by Dutch law. No quorum is required for any Shareholders’ Meeting to be held.
Dutch law requires a special majority for the passing of certain resolutions: inter alia, capital reduction, exclusion of pre-emption rights in connection with share issues, statutory mergers or statutory de-mergers. The passing of such resolutions requires a majority of two-thirds of the votes cast if 50% of the share capital with voting rights is not present at the meeting (or otherwise a simple majority).
In addition, resolutions to amend the Articles of Association or to dissolve the Company may only be adopted with a majority of at least two-thirds of the valid votes cast at a Shareholders’ Meeting, whatever the quorum present at such meeting.
What happens if shares are subject to a pledge?
Pledgees of shares and beneficiaries of a usufruct, who do not have voting rights, do not have the right to attend and to speak at Shareholders’ Meetings. The owners of shares which are subject to a pledge or a usufruct, who do not have voting rights, are entitled to attend and to speak at Shareholders’ Meetings.
How many votes do shareholders have?
In all Shareholders’ Meetings, each shareholder has one vote for each share held. The major shareholders of Airbus – as set forth in section 3.3.2 “Relationships with Principal Shareholders” of the Registration Document – do not enjoy different voting rights from those of the other shareholders.
A shareholder whose shares are subject to a pledge or usufruct shall have the voting rights attached to such shares, unless otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Association, or if, in the case of a usufruct, the shareholder has granted voting rights to the usufructuary. According to the Articles of Association and subject to the prior consent of the Board of Directors, a pledge of shares in the Company may be granted the right to vote in respect of such pledged shares.
Article 25 (paragraph 2 and 3) of the Articles of Association provides that:
“The right to vote can be granted to an usufructuary. The right to vote can be granted to a pledgee but only with the prior consent of the Board of Directors. No vote may be cast at the General Meeting of Shareholders on a share that is held by the Company or a subsidiary; nor for a share in respect of which one of them holds the depositary receipts.
Usufructuaries and pledgees of shares that are held by the Company or its subsidiaries are, however, not excluded from their voting rights, in case the right of usufruct or pledge was vested before the share was held by the Company or its subsidiary.”

Enterprise Risk Management
Minimise risks, maximise opportunities
Mitigating risks & identifying opportunities
Airbus’ long-term development and production lifecycle make Enterprise Risk Management a crucial mechanism for both mitigating the risks faced by the Company and identifying future opportunities.
By systematically integrating Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) as a key management process across the Company, Airbus supports value creation and competitiveness.
This is carefully followed by the Board of Directors (BoD).
There is one group ERM Centre of Competence with direct responsibility for Commercial Aircraft ERM and for group-wide coordination of the Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space ERM functions.
Our mission
In terms of mission, ERM plays a key role to:
Make the business more robust and become resilient to unpredicted crises
Support operational decision making
Improve the business results
Reduce the exposure level
Be compliant with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code
What supports the Airbus ERM system?
Airbus ERM system relies on:
Strong anticipation culture
Speak-up mind-set
Robust risk mitigation
Opportunity management
Strengthened ERM governance at Company, Divisions, Programmes and Functions levels
Airbus ERM uses ISO 31000 as a guideline.

Governance framework and documents
Powers: Members of the Board of Directors
The Board Rules specify that in addition to the Board of Directors’ responsibilities under applicable law and the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors is responsible for certain enumerated categories of decisions. Under the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors is responsible for the management of the Company.
Under the Board Rules, the Board of Directors delegates the execution of the strategy as approved by the Board of Directors and the day-to-day management of the Company to the CEO, who, supported by the Executive Committee and its executive management team, makes decisions with respect to the management of the Company. However, the CEO should not enter into transactions that form part of the key responsibilities of the Board of Directors unless these transactions have been approved by the Board of Directors.
Matters that require Board of Directors’ approval
Matters that require Board of Directors’ approval include amongst others, the following items (by Simple Majority unless otherwise noted):
approving any change in the nature and scope of the business of the Company and Airbus;
debating and approving the overall strategy and the strategic plan of Airbus;
approving the operational business plan of Airbus (the “Business Plan”) and the yearly budget of Airbus (the “Yearly Budget”), including the plan for Investment, Research and Development (“R&D”), Employment, Finance and, as far as applicable, major programmes;
nominating, suspending or revoking the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the CEO (Qualified Majority);
approving of all of the Members of the Executive Committee as proposed by the CEO and their service contracts and other contractual matters in relation to the Executive Committee and deciding upon the appointment and removal of the Secretary to the Board on the basis of the recommendation of the Remuneration, Nomination and Governance Committee;
approving the relocation of the headquarters of the principal companies of Airbus and of the operational headquarters of the Company (Qualified Majority);
approving decisions in connection with the location of new industrial sites material to Airbus as a whole or the change of the location of existing activities that are material to Airbus;
approving decisions to invest and initiate programmes financed by Airbus, acquisition, divestment or sale decisions, in each case for an amount in excess of €300 million;
approving decisions to invest and initiate programmes financed by Airbus, acquisition, divestment or sale decisions, in each case for an amount in excess of €800 million (Qualified Majority);
approving decisions to enter into and terminate strategic alliances at the level of the Company or at the level of one of its principal subsidiaries (Qualified Majority);
approving matters of shareholder
approving decisions in respect of other measures and business of fundamental significance for Airbus or which involves an abnormal level of risk.
The Board of Directors must have a certain number of Directors present or represented at a meeting to take action. This quorum requirement depends on the action to be taken. For the Board of Directors to make a decision on a Simple Majority matter, a majority of the Directors must be present or represented. For the Board of Directors to make a decision on a Qualified Majority matter, at least ten of the Directors must be present or represented. If the Board of Directors cannot act on a Qualified Majority Matter because this quorum is not satisfied, the quorum would decrease to eight of the Directors at a new duly called meeting.
In addition, the Board Rules detail the rights and duties of the Members of the Board of Directors and set out the core principles which each Member of the Board of Directors shall comply with and shall be bound by, such as acting in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders, devoting necessary time and attention to the carrying out of their duties and avoiding any and all conflicts of interest.
Corporate rules
The Company is governed by the laws of the Netherlands (in particular Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code) and by its Articles of Association. Airbus is also subject to various legal provisions of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht - the “WFT”).
Given the fact that its shares are admitted for trading on a regulated market in France, Germany and Spain, the Company is subject to certain laws and regulations in these three jurisdictions. As an extension to our Articles of Association, the Board and Committees have their own charter and set of rules.

What we do
Connect
Connecting for a better world
Connecting the world; Changing the future
At Airbus, we believe connections are vital to making the world a better place.
That’s why we unite people and organisations across the globe; physically, with our commercial aircraft and helicopters; and virtually with our connectivity solutions, allowing them to connect, understand each other - and ultimately change the world for the better.
Uniting people for a more prosperous future
We connect people
For half a century, Airbus’s product line of commercial aircraft has transformed the way we live and interact with the world. By truly opening borders, connecting cultures and changing the way we think and feel about our global neighbours, commercial aircraft have a major role to play in breaking down barriers and uniting people around the world.
Partnering with over 400 operators and customers, flying more than 48,000 routes worldwide, the 12,000-plus Airbus aircraft in service today connect people each day on every continent. 
Keeping our gaze to the future and in line with our core beliefs, the next challenge for Airbus is to lead the way in making low-carbon commercial aircraft a reality.
Aviation: Connecting minds, transforming lives
Air travel not only broadens our intellectual horizons, it eases tensions by bringing us together to learn from - and understand - each other, helping us find answers to our shared problems. Aviation safeguards global peace and stability. It underpins the multilateralism, diplomacy and conflict resolution that many have taken for granted in the latter part of the 20th century. Clearly, a more connected world is a more prosperous world; a prosperity that provides the foundation for innovation at scale and lasting transformation.
- Guillaume Faury, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus

What we do
Serve communities
Supporting frontline workers
Solutions for safer, stronger communities
At Airbus, we are proud of how our products and services contribute to communities around the world.
Our satellites and tracking systems help make oceans safer with solutions that monitor and protect naval routes and maritime assets. Airbus-built aircraft are instrumental in firefighting, public safety and maintaining energy systems. Our products are the workhorses that carry out construction and infrastructure projects in local communities. And technology solutions from Airbus protect many critical systems from cyberattacks, helping maintain their integrity when it’s needed most.
The workhorses for construction and infrastructure
As true workhorses in tough environments, Airbus products perform heavy lifting when needed most.
From assessing project locations with satellite imaging to delivering materials at difficult-to-access construction sites or providing on-scene live coverage of an unfolding event, Airbus products respond to a wide array of critical needs for all types of projects.
Mitigating risk with 3D satellite imaging
The workhorses
The development of many– especially those in remote areas with limited geological and topographic data – require highly accurate data to assess a project’s feasibility. Airbus’ satellite technologies provide precise digital elevation models to make decisions that help ensure the endeavour’s success.
Once a project is initiated, satellite imagery can help monitor the construction’s progress as well as providing information on its possible impacts on soil and or water quality – ensuring that projects are carried out in strict compliance with environmental standards and safety regulations.
Protecting and maintaining power lines
The workhorses
The use of helicopters for construction, surveillance and maintenance of electrical transmission grids provides vital services that keep the power on for communities around the world.Helicopters have multiple advantages in this type of aerial work, including the ability to visually inspect approximately 300 km of power lines per day from the air, rapidly detect any potential problems, and reach difficult or inaccessible areas.
Delivering materials and supplies to remote areas
The workhorses
The helicopter is often the only tool able to transport heavy loads, building materials, supplies, cargo…and more in hostile or inaccessible areas.Every Airbus helicopter version is designed to carry heavy-duty aerial cranes.
Safely delivering harbour pilots
The workhorses
Large harbours that serve as hubs for global trade often are difficult and potentially dangerous for large shipping vessels to navigate. Many require specially-trained harbour pilots who know the waters and terrain to safely bring the ship to dock.
Compared to boats, helicopters can transfer these pilots to vessels arriving at ports faster and safely, with the pilot being set down directly on the deck – eliminating the need for freeboard climbing, thereby making the journey even safer.
Newsgathering when time is critical
The workhorses
When news happens and information is needed, helicopters are on the scene in minutes to provide live coverage of everything from natural disasters to police pursuits. Knowledge is key, and helicopters can arrive at difficult-to-access locations to document unfolding events and provide the public with the information they need to know.
Public safety
Safety throughout the community is the goal of public service agencies around the world.
The men and women charged with upholding public safety rely on Airbus products for their critical missions, as deployed by local police to the coast guard, search teams, SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams and customs officials.
Last year, we successfully located 62 missing people, all still alive, but people who might well have died without the help of our police helicopter unit.
- Martin Landgraf, deputy chief of Germany’s Baden-Württemberg’s police helicopter unit
Helping keep our communities safe with helicopters
Public safety
Helicopters play a key role in ensuring safety within a community. When disaster strikes, helicopters often are first on the scene, assessing damage or casualties, providing evacuation services, critical infrastructure checks and quick reaction force deployment when an emergency situation arises. If a person goes missing, helicopters are called upon to search large areas quicker and more effectively than ground patrols.
Helping the helpers with secure communications
Public safety
Public safety organisations, such as police forces, firefighters and healthcare facilities must work together on their overlapping responsibilities – requiring them to share information and work in close coordination to ensure community health and safety. This requires reliable and efficient communication and collaboration solutions, allowing secure operations and interoperability between multiple organizations.
For over 30 years, Airbus has been a trusted partner for public safety organisations. Our field-proven and tailored solutions equip customers to handle any situation.
Energy
Helicopters are essential to keep our energy systems running. From renewable energy such as offshore wind farms to traditional energy sources like oil and gas, these rotorcraft are key components that maintain the energy industry’s operations at the optimum output.
Weather conditions in the North Sea can be tricky. Even if the wave height is really high where boats can no longer deliver mechanics to the wind parks, the helicopter is still able to do this job.
- Dennis Roggeveen, a pilot for Helicopter Travel Munich (HTM).
Unbeatable workhorse for wind energy
Energy
The investment in renewable energy sources has spurred major growth in recent years, especially in the production of offshore wind energy. Through countries’ capitalisation of this industry, the number of offshore wind farms are multiplying every year.
The challenges involved in operating increasingly distant wind turbines is where the helicopter becomes an essential tool. Helicopters can reduce a two-to-three-hour boat ride to just under 30 minutes by air, and provide essential service when seas are rough. In bad weather conditions, helicopters can still transport mechanics and equipment or intervene in an emergency.
Sustaining oil and gas operations
Energy
Traditional energy sources like oil and gas depend on helicopters to transfer crew, equipment, and medical services, along with conducting inspections and providing repair services. Offshore platforms that are difficult to access count on the speed and reliability of helicopters.
Land-based rigs in highly remote locations also require helicopter services for logistics support as well as pipeline patrols to ensure safety and environmental protection.
Firefighting
Wildfires are increasingly becoming larger, faster-spreading, and more difficult to control. Climate change is one reason for this. The hotter global temperatures have created drier conditions, sapping vegetation’s moisture. The depopulation of rural environments and the shift away from mountain living, as well as human actions, are some of the factors that make the new generation of fires more difficult to control.
Firefighting, traditionally considered to be just one of the many aerial roles of helicopters and aircraft, is now becoming one of their most critical tasks, especially in summer.
When a fire breaks out, helicopters offer the best way to reach the scene very quickly. Therefore, this is the solution that we look to first.
- Denis Bargès, Head of the Bouches-du-Rhône fire service’s Forest Fire Group Doctrine and Flight Service in France
Essential aircraft combating wildfires
Firefighting
Every minute counts when a fire breaks out. Helicopters offer the speed and ability to reach the scene quickly, dousing fires with water-bombing systems that can deliver some 800 to 4,000 litres of water every two to three minutes when a water source is nearby for refills. Early intervention with the use of helicopter-delivered water drops can slow down a fire’s progress and help in its containment.
When fixed-wing aircraft are called upon, especially for larger fires, helicopters can continue their work – supporting the teams on the ground by carrying equipment, personnel, or urgently needed water.
Cybersecurity
Major cyberattacks have the power to paralyse organisations and have become a daily menace. They can threaten national security, upend our healthcare systems, or wreak havoc on the digital tools we rely on in our everyday lives: such as clean water systems, local power grids and more. The severity of attacks underlines their potential impact on Europe’s economy and society, annually estimated at 340 billion Euros.
To counteract this threat, Airbus has developed agile solutions to protect companies, governments and critical infrastructures.
Over 170,000 security applications from Airbus are used worldwide, which are overseen by the company’s Airbus CyberSecurity business and its staff of 600 employees.
The job of the Security Operations Centre manager is to guarantee the security of the theatre's information systems. We detect and neutralise any cyber threat to enable the BARKHANE Force to use the full extent of its digital resources, factors of operational superiority. In short, to guarantee the Force's freedom of action.
- Lieutenant Philippe, Head of a French military Security Operations Centre (SOC) that relies on Airbus defensive cyber warfare technology
Trade
The aviation industry has an almost incalculable contribution to global trade and economic development, supporting more than 65.5 million jobs around the world.
Airbus alone provides employment to over 130,000 employees, and more than 12,000 international partners and suppliers.
Airbus-built freighter aircraft open up borders worldwide – providing vital connectivity links, facilitating trade and economic growth to serve a myriad of communities. Hand in hand with our customers, these freighters support companies to boost productivity, enabling the transport of a full range of cargo – from high-value consumer goods to express packages and perishables, as well as medical supplies.

What we do
Save lives
Providing urgent help
Innovating for crisis response
Airbus’ products and services are used for some of the most critical missions.
Through humanitarian aid, we support our partners in times of crisis, providing aircraft, satellite imagery and other services when relief teams are literally fighting against the clock.
Our aircraft help transport patients for urgent medical care, and they assist in search efforts to find those marooned at sea, stranded in the mountains, or isolated in remote regions. When a crisis occurs, our Earth observation satellites are tasked to acquire images of the concerned area. This imagery is delivered to relevant authorities, together with archived data, to rapidly assess the extent of damage and support rescue planning by allowing actions to be prioritized, and identifying if roads, bridges and airport runways are still operational.
At Airbus, we know this matters most – driving us in how we work and what we do.
Air medical services
When lives are at stake and emergency care is needed, air medical services are invaluable.
For most of the 20th century, an accident in a remote location or on a distant highway meant long lapses of time before medical care arrived. Afterwards, victims underwent an often equally long journey to a hospital. For many, this delay was too long.
Thankfully, emergency response systems have improved in countries around the world – particularly when it comes to air medical services.
When every second matters
Air medical services
The biggest advantage of Helicopter Emergency Medical Services - what many in the industry refer to as “HEMS” - is that emergency teams can reach a location three-to-five-times faster than ground vehicles. And in some cases, helicopters are the only vehicles capable of accessing inhospitable terrain. Thanks to HEMS, patients receive medical treatment earlier and the chance of survival in critical cases goes up.
At Airbus, we take pride in the fact that many of our helicopters were instrumental in the development of the HEMS systems in service today.
As we operate in a time-sensitive environment where every second matters, it is important for us to be equipped with the right helicopters for these demanding aeromedical missions.
- Mitsuhiro Hirata, Vice President, Aviation Operation Division of Japan's Hiratagakuen Aviation Operation Division.
Evacuations in times of crisis
Air medical services
In crisis situations,  when time is of the essence, Airbus-built A400M and A330 MRTT airlifters are used for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions. Providing both speed and the capacity to carry a large amount of onboard medical equipment, Airbus military aircraft are counted on during catastrophic events where evacuations are needed to save lives.
Flying these missions is of national importance in helping the National Health Service safeguard the health of every person in the United Kingdom – even in its most remote corners.
- Ian C., the Maintenance Operations Coordinator for the Airbus team based at RAF Brize Norton air base in Oxfordshire, UK.
Search and rescue
Whether lost at sea or in the mountains, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are often the most rapid and efficient means of bringing people to safety. With the ability to access isolated areas and inhospitable terrain, they often are the difference between life and death situations.
Maritime search and rescue
Search and rescue
When a boat or ship is lost at sea, the following hours and days that follow can be perilous. With speed and the ability to retrieve passengers in even difficult sea conditions, aircraft and helicopters are essential to finding and rescuing our loved ones.
Mountain rescue
Search and rescue
Often, the only option for finding a person lost in rugged and remote locations is by helicopter. Able to search over large swaths of terrain quickly, in areas that would otherwise be arduous and time-consuming to cover by land, the helicopter is a game-changer for rescue teams in mountainous regions.
These are operations you don’t forget.
- Rupert Gleissl, Airbus Engineer and volunteer operations manager and mountain rescuer for the mountain rescue service in Rottach-Egern in Bavaria, Germany
Humanitarian aid

Airbus believes it is every company’s responsibility to give back to society.
Through the humanitarian branch of the Airbus Foundation, we are in the unique position to not only donate financial support, but our products and personnel available in the event of a disaster. With Airbus-built aircraft and helicopters, we assist recovery missions and deliver critical supplies. Our Earth observation satellites provide imagery to assess disaster management, predict weather conditions and help rescue teams coordinate during their missions. And with our data analytics services, we support victims in their journey following a disaster, assisting them to restore a sense of normalcy as quickly as possible.
Partnering with humanitarian community
Humanitarian aid
Extreme weather conditions such as storms, floods, heat waves and droughts trigger the majority of the world’s natural disasters, and have accounted for more than 600,000 deaths in the past 20 years (based on United Nations figures). With climate change expected to intensify these events in the coming years, the role of humanitarian organisations around the world is critical.
As an airline committed to living up to our social responsibilities, we have been ferrying humanitarian shipments as part of our initiatives to give back to society. The humanitarian aid we are carrying with the delivery of the new Airbus A350-900 aircraft is an extension of our social commitments. I would like to thank Airbus for joining us in this noble initiative as it has been doing in the past.
- Ethiopian Group CEO Tewolde Gebre Mariam

What we do
Protect
Safeguarding national sovereignty
Empowering nations, strengthening diplomacy
Our defence products and services help countries protect their citizens, values and vital infrastructure. In an unstable world, this security is a prerequisite of peace, the rule of law, political stability, democracy, environmental sustainability, human rights, economic development and prosperity, and scientific progress.
Airbus manufactures helicopters, fighter jets and military transport planes that allow nations to safeguard their airspace and respond to natural disasters. We supply intelligence capabilities as well as terrestrial space and cyber security services. And we provide secure satellite communications to governments and organisations devoted to public safety. All help to make the world a safer place.
Our defence activities contribute to diplomacy, conflict resolution and a multilateral approach to international relations. By supplying EU and NATO member states with advanced military equipment, we strengthen their diplomatic influence and credibility on the global stage – and in turn that of international institutions such as the UN and NATO. 
Protecting from space
While much of our space technology is aimed at exploring the universe, it also aims to improve and safeguard life here on Earth. Protective forces grapple daily with the growing threat of terrorism as well as the challenge of defending one’s borders and ensuring the safety of civilians in an ever more complex world. Airbus is dedicated to preserving safety and protecting against security threats with our space technologies that range from satellite-based Earth observation to secured satellite telecommunications.
Airbus is one of the world leaders in designing, developing and operating major space systems.
Support from the air
Airbus is one of the world's largest suppliers of advanced military aircraft.
Our goal is to not only meet today’s military aircraft requirements – covering the entire military operational spectrum – but also to pave the way for products that respond to tomorrow’s needs.
Defence aircraft
Support from the air
Airbus’ airlifters are designed to support military, humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. They can be easily transformed from a combat role to transporting and delivering personnel and goods directly to theatres of operation, or performing air-to-air refuelling missions. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) also help safeguard our security and play an important role in various defence missions. And with the ‘Future Combat Air System’ Airbus and our partners are pioneering an ambitious new generation of defence technology which will permit Europe to address the threats of the future and defend its borders.      
Figure: 1,800+ Military Aircraft Sold / 5,200+ missions achieved with UAS
Flexible rotorcraft
Support from the air
The helicopter’s manoeuvrability, range and discretion make it an essential part of any modern military’s critical assets. Able to support ground troops, perform scouting duties, provide utility missions such as peacekeeping and personnel transport, or carry out special operations, the helicopter serves a wide array of operational needs. 
Around 2,500 Airbus helicopters are in service today with approximately 100 armed forces who place their trust in Airbus. These operators have flown a collective 30 million helicopter flight hours with Airbus products.
Safeguarding oceans and coastlines
Keeping coastlines and the high seas safe is a challenge that needs a teamwork-oriented approach, requiring the action of a handful of parties to monitor, deter, study and protect our waterways. Oil spills, drug trafficking, typhoons and more can pose a threat to the environment, national sovereignty or one’s individual safety.
For more than 50 years, Airbus has been dedicated to developing products that help governments, navies and international organisations respond to these growing threats. From ocean patrol aircraft to satellites and communications systems, the near-exhaustive array of Airbus products speaks to the importance the company places on protecting the oceans.
In the maritime sector, we provide the tools needed to protect the most important asset: the oceans. By connecting and analysing data, we deliver direct information for informed decisions.

Space exploration
We believe the exploration of our universe will enrich life for generations to come.
Our unequalled and trusted space technologies and satellite imagery solutions continually expand human knowledge of our universe, from the ability to capture critical events on Earth to providing the solutions that enable deep-space exploration.
For decades, Airbus has been at the very heart of space exploration. We are at the forefront of creating the technologies that allow mankind to send spacecraft to planets, moons and comets both near our sun and millions of kilometres away.
We strive to push the boundaries on what is possible – allowing us to learn more about our universe and helping to make it truly our home.
Taking mankind to the moon and beyond
The Artemis programme will return humankind to the Moon on the Orion spacecraft. Once this complex series of missions is accomplished, the focus will then be on using the acquired technologies and knowledge to make an even farther trip for humankind – to Mars and back.
Partnering with NASA, Airbus is involved in developing the European Service Module (ESM) – the ""powerhouse"" of the Orion spacecraft. This mission-critical component will provide propulsion, energy, and thermal control, as well as the air that astronauts will breathe while travelling in space.

Establishing a lunar outpost
After the success of the International Space Station (ISS), the international exploration community is setting its sights on a new joint collaboration to establish a lunar outpost – The Gateway. This new lunar space station will act as a home base for astronauts travelling aboard Orion spaceships – from where they can set off on further endeavours, be it the Moon or continuing their journey to Mars.
Development of the Gateway will continue throughout this decade via a coordinated international effort. With the support of Airbus, the European Space Agency (ESA) will develop a large habitation module - the I-HAB - as well as a refuelling, infrastructure and telecommunications system, called ESPRIT, for the Gateway space station.
Mars exploration
Airbus is a partner for several missions travelling to and from Mars. The ExoMars rover mission – which is the first European rover mission to the Red Planet – will search for evidence of past or present life on Mars, and help us better understand the history of water on the planet. Named “Rosalind Franklin”, the Airbus-built six-wheeled autonomous navigation rover that will drill for samples, analyse them on board and send results back to Earth along with images and atmospheric data.

Airbus is also working on two studies for ESA to design a Sample Fetch Rover and an Earth Return Orbiter. These two elements will be critical parts of a sample-return mission from Mars back to Earth. The Sample Fetch Rover will retrieve samples left by NASA’s Mars 2020 rover mission, placing them in a sample container that will be launched into orbit around Mars. The Earth Return Orbiter will capture the basketball-sized container, seal it within a biocontainment system and bring the samples back to Earth - where they can be analysed by scientists – helping to unlock the mysteries of one of our closest planetary neighbours.

Our history
Airbus history through the decades
A rich and varied heritage
The first Airbus aircraft, the A300B1, first took to the skies on October 28th, 1972. Just over fifty years later Airbus is a world leader in designing, manufacturing and delivering aerospace products, services and solutions globally.
For the A300B1 to happen it required the pooling of the vision, expertise and knowhow of the aerospace champions in the Airbus home countries. By joining forces in an until then unprecedented industrial cooperation, Airbus’ success owes as much to its culture of collaboration and diversity as it does to its pioneering spirit and innovative mindset. Many of Airbus’ sites in the four home countries are steeped in history dating back to the earliest days of aviation. Today in the 21st century, history is being written at Airbus sites all over the world as we pioneer the transition of our industry towards sustainable aerospace.
Take a journey with us, in the pages below, through some of the highlights of our company over the past 50 years, and from the companies that became Airbus over the past 110 years.
Our predecessors
From the 1910s, Europe’s aviation pioneers led rapid progress, driven by innovation and competition. World War I and II accelerated advancements like turbojet engines and radar, laying the groundwork for commercial aviation. Post-war, Europe’s aviation industry thrived, producing icons like the Concorde and Caravelle, culminating in the Airbus A300—an unprecedented multinational collaboration. Today, Airbus unites over 90% of Europe’s aerospace legacy and has become a global leader in sustainable aviation, driving industry transformation and innovation worldwide.

Our journey
In the late 1960s, Airbus’ predecessor companies from France, Germany, the UK, and Spain laid the foundation for today’s industry leader through cooperation on projects like the A300 and rotary-wing aircraft. Airbus revolutionized air travel with the A300, the first twin-engine wide-body airliner, building on innovations like the Concorde and Caravelle. In helicopters, Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) emerged as a leader after the 1992 merger of French and German divisions. Defense collaboration grew post-WWII, leading to Airbus’ unified defense industry in 2000. In space, Airbus consolidated Europe’s expertise, shaping programs like Ariane and Galileo.

Our history
Our journey | Our history
A tale of European collaboration
Descended from legends
In the late 1960s predecessor companies in France, Germany, the UK and Spain increasingly cooperated together, not only on the Airbus A300 programme, but also in the fields of rotary wing aircraft, air power and space. This is the story of how cooperation would lead to integration and the emergence of the industry leader Airbus is today.
Commercial aircraft history
The advent of the jet engine in the 1950s, revolutionised commercial air transport. The Sud Aviation SE.210 Caravelle, was one of the most advanced jetliners of its time with many innovative features. France's Sud Aviation and UK's BAC followed up with the Concorde, a symbol of successful technical cooperation, cutting edge technology and performance, which remains unrivalled. Many firsts introduced by Concorde would go on to benefit its descendants.
In 1972, Airbus presented the A300, the first twin-engine wide-body airliner, marking the beginning of a new era for air transport with increased passenger capacities and unrivalled operational efficiency.
Helicopters history
The history of the helicopter in Europe began in the 1920s and 1930s with autogyros and early rotorcraft designed by Juan De La Cierva, Paul Cornu and Heinrich Focke amongst others. But it wasn't until the 1950s that the industry really took off with the successful development of helicopter families by Sud-Aviation and Bolkow/MBB in Germany.
The merger of the helicopter divisions of France's Aérospatiale and Germany's Dasa, in 1992, gave birth to Eurocopter, which would become a world leader in its field. In 2014, Eurocopter became Airbus Helicopters, strengthening the group's position in the rotorcraft sector thanks to its successful range of helicopters.
Defence history
In the aftermath of the second World War a series of cooperation projects between France and Germany (the Nord Noratlas, Fouga Magister) followed by the joint development in the 1960s, of the Transall C-160, would lay the foundations for increased collaboration between European companies.
Illustrating the importance of a collective approach to defence challenges. The European defence industry was further bolstered under the Airbus banner in 2000, with the mergers of France's Aérospatiale, Spain's CASA and Germany's Dasa.
Space history
In 1965, France would become the third country after the USSR and the USA to put a satellite into orbit with its own launcher, the Diamant-A. This success stimulated cooperation with Germany and the UK on the Europa rocket programme which would lead to the creation of the European Space Agency (ESA) in 1975. France's Aérospatiale would go on to be the lead integrator on the Ariane programme, which became a key player in satellite launches.
In 2000, the integration of the space activities of  Aerospatiale, Dasa and Matra Marconi into Airbus consolidated European expertise, enabling the development of ambitious projects such as the Galileo program and space exploration missions..

Our history
Our predecessors | Our history
The emergence of a global company
The origins
Today, over 90% of Europe's original aviation and aerospace companies are part of Airbus. Find out how the these companies coming together led to the creation of Airbus.
The early days
The 1910s saw the emergence of a rapid growing aviation industry in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. With the outbreak of the First World War aviation would be recognized for its strategic value, leading to significant military innovations and rapid technological progress.
As the war ended, the 1920s paved the way for commercial aviation. Airlines were founded and a second generation of manufacturers would appear in Europe over the course of the decade. The public's appetite for air travel grew, and aircraft designs evolved fostering a spirit of competition and innovation, encouraging advancements in safety, range and speed.
The great technology race
The 1930s brought about further technological leaps, including the widespread use of all-metal monoplane designs with retractable landing gears. This era also saw the rise of national airlines, with governments investing heavily in their fleets to enhance connectivity and bolster national pride. During the Second World War, aviation technology underwent unprecedented advancements. The war accelerated the development of faster, more powerful aircraft.
Major innovations such as swept wings, turbojet engines, radar, pressurisation and the ejection seat were all ushered in during the Second World War. These innovations not only improved military aviation but also laid the groundwork for the post-war development of commercial aviation. The shift towards a peacetime economy would influence how the European aviation industry would be reshaped in the post-war period, requiring greater cooperation and collaboration between companies and nations.
The jet age
The late 1940s and 1950s marked a turning point in aviation history with the dawn of the jet age.  In 1952 the introduction of the de Havilland Comet heralded a new era of jet travel, significantly reducing flight times. By the late 1950s, airlines were expanding their fleets with jets, making air travel accessible to the masses. In 1955, Sud Aviation’s SE.210 Caravelle first took to the skies. The 1960s saw even more dramatic changes, including the development of supersonic transport.
The Concorde programme, a joint project between the UK and France, aimed to revolutionize air travel with speeds exceeding Mach 2. This ambitious project captured the public's imagination, symbolizing technological prowess and luxury. The Caravelle and Concorde would both be important stepping stones on the path to the Airbus A300.
A star is born
By 1970, Europe had firmly re-established itself as a leader in aviation, combining military advancements with a burgeoning commercial industry. The continent's rich aviation legacy—marked by daring pioneers, wartime innovations, and a commitment to passenger transport—would coalesce around the Airbus A300 programme.
The A300 was an unprecedented collaboration between the industry leaders in France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, which would go on to set the stage for a company that would grow into a global industry leader.
The emergence of a global company
The spirit of innovation that began in the early 20th century thrived and continues to live on in the 21st century. From its European roots Airbus is now a Global company that is leading the industry's transformation towards sustainable aerospace. The story continues...
  Aircraft profiles
Some of the most iconic aircraft of the past have been designed and built by Airbus and its predecessor companies. From the first Airbus, the A300 B1, to the 1909 Blériot XI, take a beautifully illustrated tour of some of the legendary aircraft, helicopters, launchers and satellites that have marked the history of aerospace.

Programme and risk
Our programme
While our Code of Conduct provides a useful starting point, they cannot answer all questions, nor are they sufficient to ensure that Airbus complies with the myriad legal requirements applicable to its business. Because of this, we have worked over the past several years to develop an Ethics and Compliance programme that is structured around three key risk areas: business ethics/anti-corruption compliance, export compliance and data protection compliance.
Each of these areas in turn is supported by dedicated compliance policies and a team responsible for their implementation, together with the identification and proposal of new measures to adapt to a constantly evolving regulatory landscape.
Improving our programme is a constant and ongoing process, not only in the area of business ethics/anti-corruption but across the ethics and compliance spectrum more generally.
Anti-corruption compliance
Airbus rejects corruption of any kind, whether public or private, active or passive. This means that neither we, our employees nor third parties acting on our behalf may offer, promise, give, solicit or receive – directly or indirectly – money or anything of value to or from a government official or someone in the private sector in order to obtain or retain business or secure some other improper advantage.
Airbus' anti-corruption policy summarises our zero tolerance stance. It also refers to some of the specific directives we have adopted to address key anti-corruption risk areas, such as the engagement of third parties, gifts and hospitality exchange, and making sponsorships and donations.
More broadly, business ethics at Airbus also covers other areas such as conflicts of interest, anti-competitive conduct, insider trading, fraud, etc., while also complementing the Airbus corporate responsibility programme - which focuses on managing the social and environmental impacts of Airbus’ operations.
Conflicts of interest
We do not allow personal interests to interfere, or appear to interfere, with our ability to make fair and objective decisions when performing our jobs in the best interest of Airbus.
Airbus has implemented a directive requiring employees facing a situation that represents or may represent a conflict of interest with regards to their activities with or within Airbus should proactively declare it to the Ethics and Compliance team. Examples include, among others, having a financial interest or directorship in a third-party, outside employment or a side business, or having a relative who is a public official with decision-making power that could affect Airbus.
Failing to declare and properly manage a conflict of interest situation may have negative consequences for individuals and for Airbus.
Gifts and hospitality
Gifts or hospitality shall not be extended as a way to improperly influence a business decision or gain an undue competitive advantage.
The giving and receiving of any gifts or hospitality are regulated by an internal Airbus policy and are subject to recording and pre-approval into a digital approval tool depending on their value.
Before offering or accepting any gifts or hospitality, we must ensure that (i) it is lawful, (ii) the value is reasonable and (iii) it is allowed under Airbus internal policies and standards.
Extra caution must be taken when interacting with government officials, for which specific compliance pre-approval is required as set forth in the applicable Airbus policy.
Sponsorship, membership and donations
Airbus has a sponsorships, donations and corporate memberships directive that applies to all employees. The directive incorporates mandatory recording for all projects irrespective of their values and sign-off requirements by Ethics and Compliance for projects over certain financial values, or where Ethics and Compliance ""red flags"" are identified.
All sponsorships, donations and corporate memberships entered into by Airbus must:
Have a legitimate charitable, societal, professional trade or promotional purpose, consistent with Airbus’ global strategy, priorities and values;
Comply with all applicable laws;
Be made to reputable organisations or beneficiaries;
Be properly recorded.
The sponsorships, donations and corporate memberships directive also applies to political contributions.
Intermediaries, agents
Airbus has implemented a business development support initiative directive for the approval and monitoring of commercial intermediaries/agents, requiring them to undergo an enhanced Ethics and Compliance due diligence background check and multi-level managerial approval prior to engagement. As part of the process, information gathered directly from the potential intermediary/agent is corroborated by Airbus’ own in-depth research activities, e.g. to confirm/establish the ultimate beneficial ownership of the intermediary. In the event where Airbus identifies red flags or risks that cannot be properly mitigated, in particular questions concerning ultimate beneficial ownership, the company has and will refuse new engagements and terminate existing engagements with the third party.
Commercial intermediaries’ activities are monitored on a regular basis throughout the entire life of the relationship. Payments require approval from different functions including Ethics and Compliance and finance, and are processed only upon reception of satisfactory and detailed activity reports.
Airbus systematically requires inclusion of an anti-corruption clause in its contracts with intermediaries, which includes a termination right for Airbus in case of failure by the latter to adhere to anti-corruption or other standards. Incentive schemes for agents are designed and calculated in such a way to promote ethical behaviours and discourage corrupt practices.
Lobbyists and special advisors
Airbus is committed to ensuring that any lobbying activity is undertaken in compliance with all applicable laws and its anti-corruption programme.
The Airbus Responsible Lobbying Charter provides the principles which any Airbus employee or third party representative retained by the company must adhere to when engaging with public officials in any capacity.  The principles are also reinforced by a training module available to all employees.
Supplier compliance review
Complementing the specific processes applicable to commercial intermediaries, lobbyist & special advisors, sponsorships & donations, the Ethics & Compliance team conducts screening on the entire supplier base of the group.
Consequently, all suppliers undergo an automated initial screening and ongoing monitoring through the Airbus Supplier Screening Tool.
The third-party due diligence is managed by the Ethics and Compliance team to ensure a full segregation of duty with the Procurement team, which itself maintains oversight of all supplier relationships.
Prevention of corruption related to M&A, JV and similar transactions
Airbus has implemented a directive to ensure that corruption risks associated with potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A), joint ventures (JV) and similar transactions are detected, assessed and mitigated.
The directive incorporates a number of milestones, which are reviewed from a compliance perspective at each stage of the transaction. For example, the directive sets out the requirement for Airbus to establish a potential joint venture’s ultimate ownership, understand its track record with regard to anti-corruption initiatives, and scrutinise key individuals’ historical business activities.
In addition, the directive provides for extra requirements such as the right to conduct periodic audits on a joint venture's activities.
The directive also requires that Airbus is able to terminate a joint venture following breaches of anti-corruption representations and warranties in the joint venture agreement.
Offset contracting
As part of its mission to support sales campaigns and contract execution in certain countries, Airbus may enter into offset related agreements.
Offset transactions carried out by, or on behalf of Airbus, must comply with the company's policies and all the applicable laws, which include but are not limited to: anti-corruption, export controls and local procurement laws and regulations.
All offset third parties must be reviewed from a compliance perspective prior to entry into any binding agreement or transaction.
The depth of the due diligence will depend on the level of risks implied by the offset agreement (country risk; operational risk; commercial relation type: supplier; joint venture partner; consulting services, etc.)
The company has implemented a dedicated procedure for the compliance review of offset third parties and projects. As for intermediaries and joint ventures, this includes due diligence steps to ensure the legitimate business rationale of investments, checks to confirm/establish the ultimate beneficial ownership of third parties, etc. A central business team in turn has oversight over all approved offset projects and commitments, working closely with the Ethics and Compliance team on proposed new engagements as needed.
Anti-Money Laundering
Airbus conducts business only with reputable customers, who are involved in legitimate business activities and whose funds are derived from legitimate sources.
To ensure that its customers do not present money laundering/terrorism financing risks, Airbus has implemented a directive to perform risk-based due diligence depending on the level of anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing risk induced by its prospective customer. This due diligence is also known as the ""know your customer"" (KYC) process.
Such due diligence includes identifying and understanding the identities of individual ultimate beneficial owners and the customer's source of wealth or funds.
The KYC due diligence is updated periodically on a risk basis and in case of significant changes in the relationship or activity.
The process incorporates an enhanced level of due diligence to be performed where a prospective customer resides in a Financial Action Task Force-designated high-risk or non-cooperative jurisdiction, or where other red flags are identified. In the event that red flags are unable to be mitigated at the conclusion of the divisional customer due diligence process, there will be an escalation to the Group level for additional consideration and recommendation.
Monitoring, controls and audits
The Ethics and Compliance organisation is charged with oversight and monitoring of the Ethics and Compliance programme to ensure that it is being implemented effectively. Periodic controls on key processes are performed and reports provided to the Airbus Executive Committee and Ethics and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, including recommendations to strengthen the Ethics and Compliance programme where necessary.
In addition, the Corporate Audit & Forensic Department conducts periodic (at least annual), independent audits of Airbus compliance processes to assess the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures, and allow Airbus to develop action plans for strengthening such controls.
Export compliance
Each of the countries in which Airbus does business has controls on the export and transfer of its goods and technologies that are considered to be important to national security and foreign policies. As a global enterprise, it is Airbus’ responsibility to respect and comply with each of these controls. Our export compliance directive defines our policies, processes and organisation to ensure compliance with all relevant export control laws and regulations.
Digital ethics and regulation
Airbus leverages digital technologies to contribute to our sustainability goals of respecting the planet, valuing people and enabling prosperity. We are determined to use digital technologies in a legal, responsible and ethical manner that balances humanity and technology. That includes respect for individuals’ human rights such as privacy, protecting their personal information and ensuring appropriate measures are in place to control how it is used and accessed.
Airbus is required to handle personal data in accordance with applicable data privacy laws at national, European and international levels. In doing so, Airbus seeks to apply a consistent approach, by setting data security standards for personal data processing in line with global best practices. This is embodied in part by our Binding Corporate Rules, which provide a consistent level of protection for various personal data throughout Airbus.
At Airbus, we believe Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key competitive advantage that enables us to capitalise on the value of our data, in order to bring the best to our customers. However, with great power comes great responsibility. The ethical and legal considerations surrounding AI have never been more critical. With this imperative in mind, at Airbus, we use AI in line with our AI principles:
Safety first
Wellbeing and sustainability
Human agency and oversight
Accountability and transparency
Fairness
Data privacy and governance
Procurement compliance
Airbus suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which operations are managed or services provided. In addition, wherever suppliers are located, all business should be conducted in a manner compatible with the Airbus Supplier Code of Conduct.
Suppliers are also expected to cascade these principles through their own supply chain. 
Supplier Code of Conduct

Organisation and culture
Our organisation
Our Ethics and Compliance organisation is part of the Legal Department under the ultimate responsibility of Airbus' General Counsel. The aim is to provide strong governance throughout the company with the global presence of qualified compliance officers who ensure the compliance programme is implemented in the different functional and operational areas.
They do this in close cooperation with our employees and management, who are expected to lead by example with integrity and take responsibility for compliance within their scope of activity.
Our awareness and training
While the ""tone at the top"" and leading by example are critical for the success of the Ethics and Compliance programme, it is equally important to ensure that employees and Directors receive the right level of training and awareness around the key Directives.
Airbus aims to educate its employees about the standards of conduct that apply to their jobs and the potential consequences, including on anti-corruption.
All Airbus employees receive Ethics and Compliance training including on Anti-Corruption and are required to take at least one Ethics and Compliance e-learning per year. Additionally, depending on the functions, the country and the level of risk implied by their role, some employees may be selected to attend enhanced and tailored face to face Anti-Corruption training.
Speak Up
Airbus is committed to maintaining a ""Speak Up"" culture by promoting an open and trusting dialogue with employees at all levels.
All employees are encouraged to express their views, defend their opinions, and point out unacceptable behaviour — especially behaviour that violates our Code of Conduct. Employees can raise concerns to their line manager, their human resources business partner, to a Legal and Compliance representative, or through the Airbus OpenLine hotline (www.airbusopenline.com).
The OpenLine is a channel through which employees and other stakeholders may submit an alert securely and confidentially/anonymously. Alerts could relate to our Code of Conduct, policies and standards, or to compliance with applicable laws or regulations. The use of the OpenLine is entirely optional and voluntary, and there will be no consequences for employees who do not use the system.
Airbus protects those who Speak Up and raise concerns appropriately and in good faith; we do not retaliate against anyone who raises a concern, or against those who assist in investigations of suspected violations. Retaliation can take many forms, both direct and indirect, including: harassment, exclusion from meetings, sanction, dismissal, or other discriminatory measures, in particular related to compensation, profit-sharing, free share awards, job classification, performance reviews, promotion, training, transfers, contract renewal, etc.
Investigations
Airbus takes seriously its responsibility to investigate potential instances of misconduct, whether detected in the normal course of business, via the Airbus OpenLine, or from any other source.
Airbus has developed a dedicated investigations procedure to ensure that these investigations are conducted in a consistent and professional manner in accordance with company standards and relevant laws.
Investigations are closely monitored by the investigation team to ensure a timely resolution and documentation of the investigative work performed.
In the event that misconduct is confirmed, Airbus considers not only appropriate disciplinary action for the employees involved, but also engages in a root cause analysis of the misconduct.

Shaping the future of airfreight
Versatile solutions
Freighters and airlifters
The demand for cargo has been boosted by e-commerce, and it is expected that express freight will grow by 4.4% per year and general cargo by 2.7%. Overall, over the next 20 years there will be a need for some 2,470 freighters, of which 940 will be new-build.  
Airbus provides a range of freighters with different capacities and capabilities to service the market enabling supply chain networks to transport a full range of cargo – from high-value consumer goods, manufacturing parts to express packages and perishables as well as medical supplies.

Cabin and Comfort
Providing the ultimate passenger experience
Cabin comfort can make a huge difference to the passenger experience and that is why it is a major priority for Airbus. Airbus’ innovative Airspace cabin brand – launched in 2016 – was created with passengers at heart, and built around four key pillars: comfort, ambience, services and design.
Airbus aircraft offer high levels of cabin air quality, state-of-the-art In-Flight Entertainment (IFE) systems, ambient lighting and more personal space - all ensuring that passengers arrive at their destination refreshed and ready to go. Other features make sure that cabin crew are as comfortable and well rested as possible, helping them to give the best possible service to passengers.

A relaxing environment
Light and design
Airbus cabins are designed to provide a relaxing environment for passengers. A unique and customisable welcome area, the latest in LED technology and acoustic and clean design work together to create the best possible passenger experience.
Ambient lighting
Airbus was the first manufacturer to introduce ambient lighting as a factory fit option on commercial aircraft. Pre-defined lighting scenarios use colours, brightness levels and dynamic transitions to provide a pleasant cabin atmosphere in all phases of flight. For example, this feature can be used to reduce the effects of jet lag by simulating sunrise or sunset – ensuring passengers arrive at their destination refreshed and ready to go.
Contemporary design
Airbus’ aircraft often surprise people by how quiet it is on-board. Acoustic design, spaciousness and contemporary design elements such as straight lines, clean shapes and clear surfaces make a major contribution toward stress-free and restful flights.
Cabin air flow and ventilation
How does it work?
Airbus aircraft offer one of the safest environments with air filtration systems that ensure high levels of cabin air quality for passengers and crew, thanks to a thoroughly designed cabin “Environment Control System” (ECS). 
The ECS, which controls and monitors the air quality, temperature and pressure, also ensures that the airflow inside the cabin is constantly moving: it flows from top to bottom at one metre per second. This airflow is optimised to prevent longitudinal movement, so there is no spread between adjacent seat rows.
In addition, during flight the air is constantly entering and leaving the cabin. As fresh air enters the cabin from outside, the same quantity of ‘used’ air from the cabin is expelled overboard via the pressurisation outflow valves, fully renewing the cabin air about every two to three minutes. For comparison, air in hospital rooms and classrooms is exchanged about every 10 minutes and about 20 minutes in offices.
Any recirculated air is first passed through High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestance (HEPA) filters before it is mixed with the fresh air from outside. Overall, the HEPA filters eliminate more than 99.9 percent of particles from recirculated air, ensuring that the mix of fresh and pre-filtered recirculated air is clean and virus-free. 
HEPA technology, originally developed for the US military to prevent the spread of airborne radioactive contaminants, has been installed in all Airbus aircraft since 1994. The filters, usually installed close to the centre wingbox in the underfloor area of the cabin, are known for their effectiveness in capturing microscopic airborne particulates covering typical bacteria and viruses.

Cockpits
Cockpit commonality for flexible operations
Airbus fly-by-wire technology and its commonality philosophy, make aircraft operations, training and maintenance easier, while reducing pilot training time.
Airbus’ two versions of the fly-by-wire A220 can be operated by pilots with a common type rating, while the other members of Airbus’ product line – from the single-aisle A320 Family to the wide-body A330, A350 and A380 – also are fly-by-wire aircraft that share highly similar cockpit layouts, providing the added benefit of common type ratings and mixed-fleet flying.
A220 Cockpit
The A220 Family’s state-of-the-art flight cockpit was developed to be simple, cost-effective and smart – while also reducing pilot workload and encouraging more heads-up flying. It includes such intuitive on-board equipment as a phase of flight management system (FMS), two-mode fly-by-wire flight controls and sidestick controllers.
This cockpit layout enables pilots to fly the A220 Family’s two versions – the A220-100 and longer-fuselage A220-300 variant – with the same type rating.
A320 Cockpit
The A320 Family benefits fully from the features of Airbus commonality, which airlines have come to depend on for operational versatility, for the best support of flight, cabin and maintenance crews.
Pilots can fly the A318, A319, A320 and A321 with a Single Type Rating thanks to their identical cockpits and operating procedures.
A330 Cockpit
The A330 benefits from the advanced Airbus cockpit design, which receives high marks from the thousands of pilots who fly Airbus aircraft daily.
The A330 Common Type Rating allows pilots to transition from A330 to A350 aircraft in only eight days without full flight simulator sessions. This enables carriers to use a single-fleet flying concept with a pool of pilots qualified for both aircraft, providing increased scheduling flexibility and mobility.
A350 Cockpit
Airbus is building on its cockpit design heritage to innovate and evolve the A350’s display technology further than the advances made by the A380. Six very large liquid crystal display (LCD) screens replace the 10 large LCDs on the A380, providing ample room to show all the flight and system information needed for modern air travel, with an additional display area available for future requirements.
A380 Cockpit
The A380’s flight deck has been further evolved to incorporate the latest advances in technology for displays, flight management systems and navigation.
The A380 cockpit’s has eight identical large interactive displays, with cursor control provided through a track-ball. These displays provide a much larger screen area with clearer presentations, augmented by a HUD (head-up display) that increases pilot situational awareness – particularly during the approach and landing phase.

Strengthening Airbus’ industrial system for fuselage components
At the heart of all aircraft
Aerostructures
At the heart of all Airbus aircraft are aerostructures – the major assembly elements that come together in creating their airframes, including fuselage sections, wing components and flight control surfaces, along with fairings, doors and bulkheads. The high quality and precision build of these aerostructures – along with the speed of their assembly – are critical in maintaining Airbus’ ability to deliver optimised, efficient aircraft for operators around the world.
In addition to working with key global supply chain partners, Airbus is constantly looking to strengthen its own core airframe assembly activities to meet the increasing demands of the industry in terms of technological evolution, new skills development and competitiveness.
For fuselage aerostructures activities, which previously were mostly performed both in Airbus plants and in former Airbus subsidiaries STELIA Aerospace and Premium AEROTEC, part of this journey has involved the creation of two new companies: Airbus Atlantic and Airbus Aerostructures. These two strong businesses will shape the future of Airbus products and the industrial system.

Operating life
A proven international system
The production of Airbus aircraft benefits from a truly international industrial system with cooperation across the company’s global footprint, partnered with a worldwide supply chain.
 
Airbus has evolved how its airplanes are built. New digital technologies help to deliver on time while maintaining quality, keep flexibility to adjust aircraft production, and reduce the impact of manufacturing activities on the environment for improved sustainability. 
Transforming how an aircraft is built
Looking to the future, Airbus is undertaking a major transformation called DDMS (Digital Design Manufacturing & Services), responding to the increasingly competitive marketplace, while also preparing for the next generation of low-emission aircraft.
To achieve this ambition aircraft manufacturing and assembly is evolving to bring in new processes, tools and jobs for a different way to design and build aircraft, while also offering an improved workspace for employees.
 
With increased modular design and customisation capabilities the next industrial system will leverage higher levels of standardisation and commonality of parts and major components, enabling new Build-To-Stock and Build-to-Order decoupled approaches. In the factories, teams will benefit from even more digital and connected processes, tools and devices. This will enable just-in-time operations and flexibility to produce and assemble aircraft faster, in a cleaner, more efficient and even safer environment. They will perform activities with more added value, supported by robots and using lighter-weight tooling. 
 
This ambitious makeover will enable Airbus to adapt production rates more rapidly to meet customer demand, further enhance quality, increase flexibility in the delivery of aircraft, lower the environmental impact by decarbonising manufacturing activities, and reduce costs.
From co-design to automation to decarbonisation
Four concepts will be the drivers for Airbus’ industrial system transformation: co-design; digitalisation of manufacturing processes and tools; robotics and decarbonisation.
Co-design is all about designing the new programmes at the same time as Airbus designs the industrial system, integrating the needs of manufacturing and involving the supply chain in this overall process. 
Digitalisation of manufacturing processes and tools will ensure end-to-end data continuity – from engineering to manufacturing. This will facilitate data continuity and flow, transparent collaboration, enabling substantial gains in terms of performance and efficiency, lead times, standardisation and access to operational information. 
The increasing use of robotics in Airbus’ industrial system will substantially contribute to reduce production costs and increase quality standards. It will also enable teams in the manufacturing areas to concentrate on added-value activities, letting robots do the repetitive, difficult or low added-value tasks, increasing safety and overall well-being in the manufacturing areas.
The industrial system’s transformation is also driven by the ambition of Airbus to decarbonise its overall industrial activities, further limiting their impact on the environment. This includes reducing or eliminating harmful materials and chemicals on the shop floors, cutting back on the use of water and energy in manufacturing areas, and increasing the use of 3D printed parts – even with reused materials.

Tailored solutions for each customer profile
Materials Management, Technical Support, Helicopter Maintenance, Training and Flight Ops, and Connected Services are available through five comprehensive, customer-focused lines of solutions:
HCare Initial: Tailored for customers starting operations with a new Airbus helicopter or taking delivery of a new aircraft type.
HCare In-service:  For customers already operating an Airbus helicopter type., This multi-service contract is composed of a combination of solutions that perfectly suit and support operators’ needs to optimise their operations on a daily basis. 
HCare Lifetime: HCare Lifetime is designed for operators looking for an end-to-end package and a long-term collaboration -from entry into service to the end of the aircraft's life. This multi-service contract offers the best balance of services required over the defined period, to maximise performance and safety of helicopter operations. 
HCare First: For private and business aviation operations, Airbus Helicopters offers HCare First, a service delivering the excellence and the performance they expect.. An extensive service coverage that strives for total peace of mind for PBA operators. It delivers maximum helicopter availability and budget control while embedding hassle-free solutions.
HCare Classics: HCare Classics is designed for customers operating legacy helicopters.  The solution is fully customisable and offers operators specific monitoring and solutions to keep the fleet fully operational and mission-capable at all times.
Performance commitment levels
Airbus Helicopters offers three commitment levels for material management solutions:
Guaranteed repair - Serving as Airbus Helicopters’ commitment to repair & overhaul (R&O) turn-around-times, the Guaranteed Repair programme is focused on R&O management at the component level. It enables operators to contractually secure R&O turnaround times, with the goal of improving maintenance planning efficiency while keeping property of their material.
Part availability - This exchange service is based on the replacement of parts that are reaching their time between overhaul (TBO) or service life – as well as for the replacement of failed parts within short lead times. The solution is customisable and is built on fixed hourly-rate payments, thereby making maintenance expenses predictable and streamlined. 
Fleet availability - The Fleet Availability program is for operators who want to delegate some or all airworthiness and maintenance activities outside of their organisation and ensure short lead times for parts deliveries. By selecting this customisable solution, fleet availability performance is contractually committed – allowing operators to always be mission ready.
Our global network
Airbus Helicopters is present in some 150 countries through its 30 customer centres and affiliates, 19 training centres, 96 service centres and 4 technical support hubs.

Future Combat Air System (FCAS)
Shaping the future of air power
A system of systems with the NGWS at its core
Collaborative combat
The Future Combat Air System is a key instrument for ensuring European sovereignty in defence and security. 
FCAS will be built around a core Next Generation Weapon System (NGWS). In this “system of systems,” piloted New Generation Fighters will work together with Unmanned Remote Carriers – all connected to other systems in space, in the air, on the ground, at sea and in cyberspace via a data cloud called the “Combat Cloud.” These connected platforms will act as sensors, effectors and C2 nodes, enabling agile decision making and working together within an open, scalable, service oriented architecture that allows the inclusion of future platforms and technologies.
Various national and allied platforms will supplement the NGWS in a collaborative strategy by adding their unique capabilities. Such a system-of-systems approach will enable seamless collaborative combat across domains by leveraging the connected capabilities of pooled platforms.
A milestone for European high-tech development
Future Combat Air System
FCAS marks a major leap in European defence, aiming for full collaborative combat by 2040. It will integrate enhanced platforms such as the Eurofighter and Rafale, using AI, big data, cryptography, and human-machine interaction.
As new capabilities are introduced, European air forces and navies will adapt operationally while industry will drive technological advancements. This coordinated effort will ensure Europe can meet evolving threats and maintain high-tech defence leadership.
A phased roll-out from the late 2020s
Future Combat Air System
FCAS capabilities will roll out incrementally, starting with enhanced situational awareness in the late 2020s and progressing to manned-unmanned teaming in the early 2030s. Upgraded fighters such as the Eurofighter will team with first-generation Wingman, leading to the full FCAS vision by 2040 with the Next Generation Weapon System.
Remote Carriers, launched from aircraft such as the A400M, will support manned aircraft with a high degree of autonomy, always under human control.
Sharing secured information is vital for FCAS
Future Combat Air System
Connectivity is crucial for FCAS. To operate as a system-of-systems, FCAS requires fast, secure, global communication through satellite constellations. These constellations will ensure high data rates, secure geo-navigation, and real-time, reconfigurable coverage.
Multiple Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance sources, including radar and Eurodrone optronic cameras, will enable rapid, near real-time situational awareness across air, ground, and sea, ensuring mission success.
The role of Airbus in FCAS
Future Combat Air System
Airbus is co-leading the overall FCAS programme, in particular the System of a Systems approach, and is the main partner for the New Generation Fighter demonstrator pillar.It is leading the pillars for vehicle development of the Remote Carriers, the Combat Cloud, along with work relating to enhanced low observability.
The company has extensive experience in the management and production of major European defence and space secure communications programmes.
FCAS is vital for Europe’s future
FCAS is key to ensuring Europe's future independence in defence and security. It will strengthen Europe as a centre of advanced industry and technology beyond the defence sector to potential civilian applications. 
The programme is also expected to benefit the economies, labour markets and defence sectors of the participating countries over the coming decades, which could be further boosted by potential export sales to approved military services.

Telecommunications and Navigation satellites
Airbus is a global leader in communications and navigation satellites, delivering solutions to operators worldwide, connecting people.
Tailored solutions for different applications
Seamless, high-speed communications and internet services around the globe would not be possible without telecommunications satellites.
The growing demand for connectivity, fast, reliable and secure communications, added to increasing use of data have made telecommunications satellites a critical asset. We help people connect with our Geostationary satellites such as Eurostar Neo and OneSat, and our Low Earth Orbit constellation Oneweb.
Navigation satellites are equally essential, guiding us safely and accurately around the globe. Our navigation systems have helped revolutionise the way we live (satnav, delivery services, location-based applications).
Galileo, Europe's Global Navigation Satellite System, enables us to calculate our position and time on Earth with pinpoint accuracy. It opens up opportunities for a wide range of services such as critical emergency response, time-stamped financial transactions, and precision agriculture.
The EGNOS system improves the accuracy of Galileo and GPS systems, increasing navigation performance and safety during critical phases such as aircraft landing.

Space exploration
Airbus is a leader in the fields of exploring the universe, scientific experiments platforms and establishing a human presence in space.
Pushing engineering to its limits
For decades, Airbus has been at the heart of space exploration, developing the technology that enables mankind to send spacecraft to planets, moons and comets.
Our clean rooms have been the starting point for several missions, including: Mars Express, Gaia and JUICE for which we designed and built the satellites for the European Space Agency (ESA).
NASA is planning to land astronauts on the Moon again with its Artemis programme. And for the first time ever, it has selected a non-US company, Airbus, to build the Orion European Service Module (ESM).
The commercial use of the International Space Station (ISS) is opening up opportunities for access to space. Whatever the mission in low Earth orbit, Airbus offers mission services on board the ISS, hosting either external payloads or experiments inside the ISS, as well as other microgravity options.
We are preparing for when the ISS comes to the end of its life with Starlab, the next generation space station.

Crisis Management
Delivering the right solutions to meet the crisis management needs of today and tomorrow
Improved monitoring, response and resilience
At Airbus, we deal with all kinds of crises: natural or man-made disasters, industrial accidents, confrontations or malicious acts. 
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, forest fires, hurricanes or volcanic eruptions, as well as man-made disasters, regularly cause significant hardship to populations and damage to infrastructure and the environment.
In addition, industrial accidents can never be completely avoided, no matter how many precautions are taken. And confrontations or acts of malevolence are a fact of life in our world. It is therefore essential for all those involved in crisis management and disaster relief to improve their ability to anticipate and respond in order to mitigate the effects of disasters.
A reliable partner for crisis management
Effective crisis management is a collaborative effort between government, civil society and the private sector at all stages: from effective prevention and preparation, through rapid response, to recovery and evaluation of the lessons learned.
Drawing on many years of experience, Airbus offers advanced solutions for critical communications, connectivity and geo-information throughout a crisis, all tailored and scaled to the needs of the user.
Our assets for crisis management
Versatile and efficient tactical aircraft
The C295 is ideal for all types of crisis relief and humanitarian missions. Tough, solid, rugged and with excellent low-level flying capabilities and short take-off and landing times from unprepared rough, soft and short airstrips.

Sustainable aviation fuels
A new generation of reduced emissions fuels
What is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?
For almost a century, aircraft have been fueled by kerosene. Now, a new generation of sustainable aviation fuels has the potential to halve the aviation industry’s carbon emissions by 2050.
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is certified jet fuel (Jet-A/A1). However, unlike traditional jet fuel fully derived from fossil resources, today's SAF is a blend of conventional fossil fuel and synthetic components made from a range of renewable “feedstock” (such as used cooking oils, fats, plant oils, municipal, agricultural and forestry waste).
All Airbus aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of SAF and conventional fuel. However, by 2030, all our aircraft and helicopters will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF.
ASTM International, a global standards and testing body, has approved eight technical pathways for producing SAF. Each pathway has its own set of requirements based on different feedstocks and conversion processes.
Airbus Summit 2025
The Airbus Summit 2025 brought experts together to talk about pioneering sustainable aerospace and how we are shaping the future of aviation.
Learn more
How is SAF made?
Here are just three of the most common pathways:
- HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids): The HEFA process refines vegetable oils, waste oils, or fats into SAF through hydrotreating and hydroprocessing. 
- Alcohol to Jet: Alcohol to Jet (AtJ) converts alcohols such as ethanol and iso-butanol into SAF by removing the oxygen and linking the molecules together. 
- eFuels: SAF can be produced using green hydrogen, capturing carbon dioxide, and using renewable electricity to create synthetic fuels. This type of SAF is sometimes referred to as eFuel or Power-to-Liquid (PtL).
How does SAF reduce the aviation industry's carbon footprint?
Air transport represents approximately 2-3% of global human-induced GHG emissions. SAF is one of the means the aviation industry is using to reduce that carbon footprint.
On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation.
The key to SAF's impact lies in its life cycle. When burned, SAF still produces emissions similar to those emitted by fossil fuels. But unlike conventional jet fuels, which take fossil resources out of the ground and release previously stored carbon into the atmosphere, SAF primarily uses carbon that is part of the current carbon cycle in various feedstocks. This means that the CO2 emitted during an aircraft's flight is re-absorbed by the biomass used in SAF production.

1 - What is SAF ?
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable jet fuel that can reduce CO2 emissions by 80% on average and is being developed to eventually power aircraft with up to 100% SAF, without the need for blending with fossil fuels. This video illustrates what SAF is and its use in aircraft today.

3 - Why SAF ?
What challenges are delaying SAF uptake?
The SAF ecosystem is in its infancy. In 2023, SAF volumes reached over 600 million litres (0.5Mt), double the 300 million litres (0.25 Mt) produced in 2022 but still only amounting to 0.2% of all aviation fuel for the year. Limited volumes mean SAF is much more expensive than conventional jet fuel.
As production expands SAF will likely be able to compete on price, but this is not a given; it requires collaboration between governments, industry and regulators on a global scale.
Appropriate regulatory mechanisms and inventive structures still need to be put in place, and even then, there are challenges associated with the limited availability of land and biowaste.
As the SAF ecosystem matures, it is expected that multiple pathways utilising the most regionally appropriate feedstocks will be established. It is clear that both biomass sources and eFuels will be necessary to meet demand.
What is Airbus doing to increase SAF usage?
Airbus is increasing the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of 15% SAF in our global fuel mix by the end of 2024 and at least 30% by 2030.
We have been accompanying our customers in their own reduced emissions journey, giving them the option to fuel their new aircraft with SAF since 2016.
Airbus is conducting flight tests with 100% SAF, exploring the impact of SAF emissions (both contrails and non-CO2) on the atmosphere.
The Airbus employee travel policy offers SAF to airlines for all employee business travel and we fuel our shuttle flights with SAF when the aircraft is fuelled on Airbus premises and where SAF is available.
Airbus supports the large-scale development of SAF and has been actively engaged in certification processes and demonstration projects. We collaborate with airlines, airports, SAF producers and research institutions around the world to help advance the SAF ecosystem, addressing the policy and regulatory environment and the drivers of supply and demand.

Hydrogen
An important decarbonisation pathway for aviation
Investing in hydrogen propulsion technology
AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT
To ensure that future generations can continue to experience the joy of flying, Airbus is investing in several promising decarbonisation solutions. One of these is hydrogen, as hydrogen-powered aircraft offer the potential to reduce aviation's reliance on fossil fuels. 
Hydrogen has been safely and effectively used in the space and automobile industries for decades. Today’s challenge is to adapt its use to commercial aviation. Hydrogen’s extremely high energy-to-mass ratio makes it very appealing for aerospace applications, providing the potential for significantly cutting emissions. The main hurdle is its low ambient density, which means it needs to be stored on the aircraft at -253°C. This requires advanced storage technologies to make hydrogen practical for use on an aircraft. 
Airbus committed to taking on this challenge in 2020 when it launched the ZEROe project, which aims to bring a hydrogen-powered aircraft to the skies. After investing in research into both hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cell technology, Airbus determined in 2025 that fuel cells are the most promising option for a future hydrogen-powered aircraft. 
ZEROe: a hydrogen-powered, fully electric aircraft
FUTURE AIRCRAFT
After extensive research, Airbus has determined that the most promising use for hydrogen in aviation is through hydrogen fuel cells. This means the future ZEROe aircraft will be fully electric. It will feature four electric propellers, each powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which transform the hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction.

Developing hydrogen fuel cells for aviation purposes
POWERING HYDROGEN FLIGHT
After almost five years of research into hydrogen propulsion, Airbus has determined that the most promising technology will be hydrogen fuel cells. These cells are scalable, meaning they can be combined into fuel cell stacks to increase their power output. Airbus founded Aerostack, a joint venture with ElringKlinger, to research, develop and assemble the fuel cell stacks for the future ZEROe aircraft.

Contributing to a global hydrogen ecosystem
COLLABORATING ON HYDROGEN
In order for ZEROe to be a success, more investment in hydrogen storage and infrastructure is needed. Significant technological, economic, and regulatory hurdles remain before hydrogen can be adopted at scale within the aviation sector. To support the expansion of this industry, Airbus is collaborating with a variety of industry players, including energy providers and airports, to ensure hydrogen can help us to take significant steps towards decarbonising aviation.

Contributing to global decarbonisation goals
A DIVERSIFIED APPROACH
Airbus is committed to helping the aviation industry decarbonise. The ZEROe project is just one of several pathways we are pursuing in pursuit of this goal. We are also developing a next-generation single-aisle aircraft that will bring significant improvements in costs, operations and emissions reductions. In parallel, we are investing in future technologies, air traffic management solutions, sustainable aviation fuels and more.

Hybrid and electric flight
Laying the groundwork for decarbonising aviation
On the path to lower-carbon flight
REDEFINING PROPULSION
A range of technologies are required in order to meet the aviation industry’s decarbonisation ambition. Chief among them are promising propulsion concepts, such as electrification, hybrid-powered flight and hydrogen fuel cells. At Airbus, our research into electrification aims to lay the groundwork for the future industry-wide adoption and regulatory acceptance of alternative means of propulsion for aircraft, helicopters and urban air vehicles.
Hybrid-electric aircraft propulsion
In a hybrid configuration, an aircraft uses several energy sources in flight, either in tandem or alternately. The mix of energy sources optimises overall energy efficiency and reduces fuel consumption.
Hybrid-electric propulsion leads to better energy management, reducing fuel consumption by up to 5% compared to a standard flight. The electricity can come from batteries or fuel cells that convert hydrogen into electricity.
Collaborating on hybridisation research
We are working closely with key industry players to advance hybridisation research. In November 2022, Airbus and Renault Group signed a research and development agreement which aims to accelerate both companies’ electrification roadmaps.
In June 2023, Airbus and STMicroelectronics signed an agreement to advance research on the next generation of semiconductors, which will be a key enabler of hybrid and fully electric aircraft such as the ZEROe demonstrator and CityAirbus NextGen.

Solar flight
Harvesting the sun’s rays to power aircraft
High-altitude flight powered by the sun
PUSHING THE LIMITS
The sun’s rays bathe our planet with vast amounts of energy – approximately 885 million terawatt hours every year. At Airbus, we are working to use this alternative renewable energy source to power high-endurance stratospheric flight. Our advances in solar cell technology enable unmanned aerial vehicles to stay aloft in the stratosphere for extended periods, using only sunlight as energy.
Our work in solar flight is focused on:
- Developing advanced photovoltaic solar panels that are lighter, more flexible and capable of capturing more energy per surface m2
- Converting captured solar energy into electrical energy to power an electric-propulsion system and other onboard equipment
- Harnessing solar energy into a rechargeable energy storage system, thereby enabling the aircraft to fly at night with unlimited autonomy
Taking unmanned aerial vehicles into the stratosphere
Our flagship programme, Zephyr, is a high-altitude pseudo-satellite that is powered exclusively by solar power. Known as a high-altitude platform station (HAPS), it can fly non-stop for months at a time. Zephyr provides two key services: it can relay high-quality imagery and live video, and it also serves as a communications tower in the sky, capable of being seamlessly integrated into mobile operator networks.

Air traffic management
Reducing emissions by optimising flight
Optimising flight to reduce emissions
RETHINKING OPERATIONS
Operational improvements can reduce our environmental impact. By optimising flight trajectories and coordination with air traffic management partners, we are contributing to the European ATM Master Plan’s goal of reducing average CO2 flight emissions by 5-10%.
ATM organisation and rules are designed to permit safe increases in air traffic. We are deploying a variety of air traffic management solutions to reduce emissions, including services and software upgrades. We are also working on our own pioneering solutions to further optimise air traffic management, including systems upgrades, so that ATM services enable the best use of aircraft while maintaining airspace capacity.
Improving flight operations
ATM solutions and operational measures can reduce the impact of air travel on the environment. All flight phases are concerned, including continuous climb and descent operations, flight trajectory optimisation and hybrid on-ground operations.
Airbus is an active member of the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Joint Undertaking, which works to enhance ATM procedures to reduce emissions. More than 500 demo flights have been performed to test ATM solutions, and further demo flights are planned as technologies evolve.
Wake energy retrieval
Airbus is participating in multiple projects investigating wake energy retrieval (WER). By coordinating flights so that one aircraft follows another, the second aircraft benefits from free lift, thus requiring less engine thrust, which reduces fuel consumption and creates up to a 5% reduction in CO2 emissions. We hope to demonstrate the operational feasibility of the concept in order to enable the introduction of WER flights into ATM operations.
Learn more
Trajectory based operations
Trajectory based operations (TBO) are a way of managing air traffic based on predicted and planned flight trajectories. This allows trajectories to be optimised by air traffic control, all while ensuring the safety of every aircraft from takeoff to landing. By transmitting four-dimensional trajectory data (latitude, longitude, altitude and time), aircraft trajectories can be better coordinated, leading to lower fuel burn and fewer carbon emissions. Airbus is collaboratively researching TBO with air traffic control partners and airlines.
HERON: increasing fuel efficiency
In nature, the heron is a graceful bird that is highly adaptable to changing environmental conditions. In aviation, HERON is the name of an Airbus-led European project about fuel-efficient flight operations.The project aims to demonstrate how innovative flight operations can reduce the environmental impact of aviation. It falls within the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Programme, and is scheduled to run until late 2025.

Autonomous flight
Towards a world of more autonomous air travel
Pioneering automated flight systems
PUTTING SAFETY FIRST
Over the last 100 years, as the aerospace industry has emerged, evolved and improved, automation and autonomous technologies have played a key role in helping us increase the safety of our products and their operational efficiency.
Assisting flight operations safely and efficiently
Emerging technologies, systems and solutions, assist flight operations in a crucial role: they are the tools that will enable the aerospace industry and its customers to thrive long into the future and they are equally essential to our vision: “to pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world.“
Whatever the level of “autonomy” (from automation systems to fully autonomous vehicles), we use these technologies to keep our products state of the art, improving the human/machine interface. We adapt the level of automation according to the market segments, products, environment and expected benefits to reach our shared goal: the safest and most efficient operations. 
According to what we aim to achieve and the market expectations, we see the potential for diverse applications of autonomy, and we are preparing safety and operational improvements for all products as a result. Further, sustainability is a key driver for Airbus as well as a responsibility of both today's society and businesses. As we continue to grow and innovate as both an industry and an organisation, sustainability is a priority across our products with autonomy as a vital contributor to the future success of our market.

Unmanned traffic management
Building the safe airspace of the future
Planning for tomorrow’s skies
SEAMLESS OPERATIONS
Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) is building digital air traffic management solutions for the next age of aviation. Airbus designs, develops and builds the infrastructure necessary to allow existing aircraft to continue operating in lower airspace and to permit future vehicles, including delivery drones and air taxis, to safely enter and share airspace in the future.
Joint airspace management for safe future airspace
The lower airspace of the future will be populated with familiar helicopters, but also with futuristic aircraft such as delivery drones and air taxis, also known as electrical vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs).
To safely manage all these air vehicles, our joint airspace will need a scalable approach to air traffic management (ATM).
Airbus believes UTM is a fundamental enabler of an integrated, accessible airspace that will support a wide range of new vehicles and operations.
  The 6 core principles to Airbus UTM deployment
Scalable
The ability to support UTM functions at scale: whether the various operations that UTM must provide can reasonably be built using an accompanying digital platform.
Safe
The platform must be able to enable a reliable UTM system that is available for safe operation at scale, and that allows the holistic design of failure handling across the system.
Secure
The platform must be sufficiently secure for safe operation. High assurance development, authorization and authentication, and defence in depth mechanisms must be supported.
Future-proof
The platform must support future vehicles, missions, and systems. The world is changing rapidly and we must design a system which can support this.
Interoperable
Defining standards and regulatory frameworks that drive interoperability are critical to ensuring overall efficiency and safety of UTM deployments.
Sustainable
UTM functions are a critical component of the future airspace ecosystem, and will unlock operational efficiencies and enable new vehicle types to operate safely and sustainably.

Non-CO2 emissions
Reducing and mitigating non-CO2 climate effects of aviation
Developing operational solutions
STUDYING CLIMATE IMPACTS
The decarbonisation of the aviation industry is a key focus for Airbus, and mitigating non-CO2 emissions is a contributor to our decarbonisation ambitions.
Airbus is leading a variety of flagship projects to explore ways of reducing or mitigating the climate impacts of non-CO2 emissions. We are working with key industry partners, research institutions, universities and stakeholders from different sectors to better understand these emissions and develop operational solutions to mitigate them.
Airbus Summit 2025
The Airbus Summit 2025 brought experts together to talk about pioneering sustainable aerospace and how we are shaping the future of aviation.

What are non-CO₂ emissions?
Burning jet fuel creates both carbon dioxide (CO2) and non-CO2 emissions. Non-CO2 emissions consist mostly of water vapour and soot.
At altitude, in certain conditions water vapour freezes around soot particles. This forms ice clouds known as condensation trails, or contrails - the white streaks behind aircraft in flight.  
Calculating contrails’ climate effect is complex. It depends whether they are persistent, when and where they are formed and whether they have a cooling or warming effect: contrails both reflect incoming solar radiation and trap outgoing heat.
How is Airbus taking action to mitigate non-CO₂ emissions and contrails?
Airbus is working with research scientists, policymakers and the aviation industry to better understand and reduce non-CO₂ impacts. This includes:
Research & flight trials: Studying contrails and testing fuel alternatives to reduce their impact. 
Contrail avoidance: Exploring new flight paths that minimise persistent contrails. 
New technologies: Investing in hydrogen-powered flight and innovative propulsion systems for cleaner aviation.
Non-CO₂ emissions are an urgent but solvable challenge, and Airbus is leading the way in finding solutions.
CICONIA
Current projects
This Airbus-led project within the EU’s SESAR programme is assessing the impact that atmospheric conditions, aircraft characteristics and fuel have on non-CO₂ emissions. This includes how contrails could be mitigated through adapted flight operations to reduce aircraft-induced climate impacts.
Blue Condor
This demonstrator flies a modified glider to 33,000 feet – an extreme altitude for an aircraft that normally cruises below 10,000 feet – to analyse the impact of hydrogen combustion on contrail properties. The result of this analysis will provide critical information on aviation’s non-CO₂ emissions, including contrails and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

PACIFIC
The PACIFIC consortium brings together 11 partners from four countries to investigate the impact of fuel composition and engine cycle on particle emissions at different scales. 
PACIFIC seeks to bridge the gap in understanding aviation’s non-CO₂ emissions by testing an unprecedented range of fuels under controlled conditions. PACIFIC will ensure consistency in combustion parameters and hardware similarity from lab-scale experiments to full aircraft engine tests. The multiyear project launched in January 2025.

Quantum technologies
A potential game-changer in aerospace
Tackling the most complex challenges
OPENING NEW OPPORTUNITIES
Quantum technologies are expected to create a massive paradigm shift in the way aircraft are built and flown. At Airbus, we aim to be an early adopter of quantum technologies to enhance the performance of our products and services, and to help us solve the most complex aerospace challenges.
Leveraging quantum to solve aerospace challenges
Airbus is exploring a number of quantum technologies that can be applied to aerospace challenges. These technologies include the following:
Quantum computing
The aerospace industry has complex computational needs in the areas of fluid dynamics, finite-element simulations, aerodynamics, flight mechanics, and more. Airbus actively uses advanced computing solutions in these areas. We strongly believe quantum computing, in tandem with more traditional high-performance computing (HPC) solutions, can help us to solve key computationally intensive tasks.
Quantum communication
Today’s cryptographic algorithms – such as the widely used encryption via asymmetric keys – will not be able to sustain attacks by the quantum computers of tomorrow. Our goal is to develop a future secure communications infrastructure for our aerospace platforms based on security-enhancing quantum information technologies (algorithms, authentications, keys).
Quantum sensing
Quantum sensors are effective at measuring physical quantities such as frequency, acceleration, rotation rates, electric and magnetic fields, and temperature with the highest relative and absolute accuracy. We believe this could have direct applications in improving our navigation systems in which precise acceleration measurement is used to achieve position data. In addition, quantum sensors could act as payloads for a range of different applications, such as climate dynamics from satellites or underground resources surveying from an aircraft.
Partnering with quantum technology experts
Quantum technologies will enable Airbus to answer advanced flight-physics challenges. To do so, we partner with external experts—from academia and start-ups to industry—to optimally merge quantum technologies and capabilities with our aerospace competencies.
Examples of our collaborations include the following:
Airbus has established a partnership with IonQ to collaborate on the development of quantum algorithms for aerospace use cases in the field of optimization.
Airbus Ventures has invested in IonQ, Q-CTRL, and QC Ware, amongst others, and continues to seek out startups significantly impacting the future of quantum technology.
The Airbus Quantum Computing Challenge builds bridges to academia and start-ups by enabling participants to work on real industrial cases across a variety of aerospace challenges,
We also provide support to the University of Bristol's Quantum Technology Innovation Centre.
In 2023, Airbus, BMW Group, and Quantinuum published the results of a research focused on modelling chemical reactions within hydrogen fuel cells, with the objective of developing new and better performing materials. This research aims to address a significant challenge in the development of Airbus's hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Designing the future of aerospace propulsion
FLYING FORWARD
Airbus is committed to pioneering the future of aviation by developing cutting-edge propulsion technologies that will power the next generation of aircraft. With a focus on sustainability, efficiency, and innovation, we are exploring a range of transformative engine options to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. These include open fan, hydrogen, electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems, all of which hold the potential to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to current propulsion technology.
Airplane engines are critical to safety, operational and economic performance, and environmental efficiency. Airbus works closely with engine manufacturers to find ways to improve all of these metrics. We also work closely with key stakeholders, including governments, industry partners, and research institutions, to accelerate the development of innovative propulsion technologies.
The open fan revolution
Airbus is working with propulsion experts CFM on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator. Open fan technology is promising because it drastically improves fuel economy without sacrificing the cruise speed of a turbofan. The RISE engine will be flight tested on an Airbus A380 test platform by the end of the decade, and this EU-funded OFELIA project aims to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 20% compared to today’s narrow-body engines.
SWITCH: collaborating on novel engine design
SWITCH (Sustainable Water Injecting Turbofan Comprising Hybrid-Electrics) aims to demonstrate the potential of hybrid-electric and heat-recovery turbofan technologies to improve fuel efficiency by 25% and reduce carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions. Part of the European Union's Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking, the project is being led by MTU Aero Engines AG with the support of Airbus, Pratt & Whitney, Collins Aerospace and GKN Aerospace.

Future materials
A new generation of advanced aerospace concepts
Researching cutting-edge new materials
EXCITING POSSIBILITIES
Over recent decades, the aerospace industry has developed a range of materials to support novel concepts and product platforms. The materials behind future advanced concepts must be more durable, lightweight and cost-efficient than ever before. They range from metals, ceramics and coatings to composites.
Airbus is exploring the potential of these materials with a focus on sustainability, circularity and digitalisation. Improvements for the next generation of aircraft are likely to originate in improved sourcing and circularity to counter resource scarcity; and less energy-intensive production methods.
Sustainability
Minimising resource use and optimising the disposal of materials can help mitigate a product’s carbon footprint across its lifecycle. This improves its overall environmental impact.
When possible, materials should be bio-sourced, REACH* compatible and respect guidelines for the sourcing of critical raw materials. Material circularity is important for composites, thermoplastics and aluminium in particular.
*Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (European Union regulation)
Digitising the materials domain brings major benefits
Adaptability: In a fast-changing world, adaptability depends on access to data to adjust product design in the face of new regulations, materials shortages or geopolitical uncertainty.
Ways of working: A leaner, connected organisation presents a competitive advantage. Data continuity results in high quality parts and full materials tracking, traceability and conformity.
Digital twins: These virtual carbon-copies of our products evolve with the aircraft. They are dynamic, responsive and interactive, and essential at every stage of the product lifecycle from procurement to operation.
Powerhouse computing: Quantum has the potential to model materials behaviour at the molecular level. For example, it is capable of modelling corrosion inhibition processes. This in turn will enable us to accurately design coatings that stand surface degradation to a far greater extent.

Thermoplastics
Our research areas
Thermoplastic polymers present a weight advantage over carbon composites, which are used to build major aircraft components. They are easier to recycle and repurpose, their production is less energy-intensive than carbon fibre composites and they enable fuselage sections to be assembled using novel methods.
To explore thermoplastics' potential, Airbus participated in the development of the Multi-Functional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD) consortium as part of the EU’s Clean Sky 2 programme. A secondary goal of the MFFD was to investigate enablers of thermoplastic composite fuselage barrel production at a rate of between 60 and 100 aircraft per month.

Biomimicry – or biologically inspired engineering – is the study and imitation of nature’s best-kept secrets to help solve human challenges. Today, nature is providing Airbus with invaluable insight on how to make aircraft lighter and more fuel efficient. One example of biomimicry in aerospace is winglets, the vertical wing-tip extensions that resemble a shark’s dorsal fin and which significantly reduce the size of the wingtip vortex, thus reducing induced drag.

Environmental responsibility
A lifecycle approach to environmental impact
Overview
Lifecycle management
Manufacturing footprint
In-flight operations
At Airbus, our approach to environmental responsibility starts at the design stage and it doesn’t end there. During the manufacturing process, after delivery, and even at the end of an aircraft’s service life, we continue to search for ways to reduce the global environmental footprint of our aircraft. 
Environmental responsibility across the entire lifecycle
 An aircraft has an average lifespan of approximately 30 years before retiring from service. We believe in managing our products' environmental footprint across the entire lifecycle – including after they leave the final assembly line.   
Design: We significantly invest in R&D to design aircraft with lower fuel burn and that achieve better environmental performance than previous generations of products, including reduced NOx and CO2 emissions.
Production and manufacturing: We use the environmental management system ISO 14001 to manage the footprint of our industrial operations. 
Responsible supply chain: We work closely with our suppliers to select materials that are sourced ethically and responsibly with lower impact on the environment.
Operations: We support our customers throughout the aircraft’s entire service lifespan by developing sustainable fuels and air traffic management solutions as well as by offering services for fleet optimisation and in-service data analysis.
End-of-life recycling: We dismantle our aircraft in a manner that maximises reuse and recycling, and focuses on the safe disposal of non-recyclable parts.
Reducing our manufacturing footprint at sites worldwide
 Today, more than 85% of our 130,000 employees work under ISO 14001, which defines strong criteria for managing environmental responsibility.
Our high5+ programme targets a significant reduction of our environmental footprint in manufacturing activities. We measure our progress and publish it in the Annual Report.
CO2: Airbus is committed to contributing to the Paris Agreement targets and leading the decarbonisation of the aviation sector in full collaboration with all stakeholders. We are accelerating our decarbonisation plan by committing to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 industrial emissions by 63% by 2030 in line with a 1.5°C scenario. The use of sustainable aviation fuel combined with improved efficiency in operations will support this ambition, in addition to:
 Energy: A significant portion of our manufacturing footprint originates from our energy consumption. Today, we are working to increase the share of renewable and low-carbon energy at our sites. Improved monitoring, increased efficiency for lighting, heat and steam, and new construction in line with certified building standards are additional initiatives currently underway.
 Water: To limit our water consumption, we focus on increasing water recycling and reuse in our industrial activities. Increased measuring and monitoring is not only key to raising awareness of good practices, but also to finding opportunities to further reduce waste and detect leaks. 
 Air emissions: Air emissions, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are mainly related to surface cleaning, or treatment and paint. Even with delivery rates increasing, we aim to maintain 2015 levels.
 Waste: New ambitions as part of the high5+ programme have been set for waste management for 2030. These include reducing the amount of waste we produce by 20%, diverting waste from landfilling and avoiding incineration without energy recovery.
Optimising fuel efficiency during operations
Our mission to develop aircraft that produce fewer emissions does not end at the design stage. All in-service aircraft can continue to improve their fuel consumption by optimising their  air traffic management practices. 
Air traffic management
Reducing emissions by changing the way we fly
Direct routings can result in approximately 10% less fuel consumption in aircraft, as well as significantly reduced CO2 and noise emissions. This is why we develop modern air traffic management systems in collaboration with our subsidiary Airbus NavBlue and work closely with a range of partners to further optimise in-flight operational efficiency.  
Read more
Recycling or reusing up to 90% of our aircraft
 Within the next 20 years, more than 12,000 aircraft are expected to retire from operations. If not properly recycled, these end-of-life aircraft will contribute to a lot of waste in landfills. 
In 2005, we were proud to be the first manufacturer to undertake a voluntary approach to aircraft decommissioning and aircraft recycling. Today, Airbus and Tarmac Aerosave have established a proven method for decommissioning, dismantling and recycling the entire Airbus aircraft product range in an environmentally responsible way. We are able to recycle 92% of an aircraft's total weight.
Where there are parts that we cannot recycle, our focus is on safe disposal of this waste.

Climate monitoring
Geospatial data to help fight climate change
Over the past 50 years, remote sensing via satellites has yielded both spectacular views of our planet and unprecedented scientific insights.
Today, Earth observation satellites are at the forefront of monitoring deforestation, rising sea levels and greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere.
At Airbus, we not only build many of these satellites but transform geospatial data into actionable insight to help our partners fight climate change.
Satellites to monitor climate change
More than 150 Earth observation satellites are currently in orbit. Their mission is to provide scientists with the essential data needed to detect environmental changes on Earth. Because more than 50% of climate variables can only be measured from Space, Earth observation satellites are a vital tool to monitor the effects of climate change on natural ecosystems.
We are involved in all major environment-monitoring satellite programmes in Europe and play a role in all 12 of the Copernicus missions.
At any one time, 20 of our satellites are involved in climate change monitoring and an additional 20 are in development. Our complete fleet of satellites measures:
Key atmospheric constituents
Land and sea topography
Air quality, temperature and humidity 
Snow and ice coverage
This critical geospatial data enables us to:
Provide scientists with a better understanding of the Earth’s system and evolution
Help governments and humanitarian agencies prepare for and manage disasters
Generate environmental impact assessments for large industries
Earth observation satellites
  Aeolus
Equipped with a Doppler wind LIDAR, this satellite monitored the Earth’s wind patterns on a global scale for almost five years. The observations were used to improve weather forecasting and climate models and a future generation satellite is being considered by the European Space Agency.
For more information on Aeolus click here.
Airbus satellite fleet
Owned and operated by Airbus, this satellite fleet delivers geo-intelligence services for a variety of applications. Current in-orbit satellites include optical satellites Pléiades Neo, SPOT and Pléiades, as well as Vision-1 and the DMC Constellation, and radar satellites TerraSAR-X, Tandem-X and PAZ.
Biomass
Currently in production, this satellite will monitor levels of carbon captured by trees. The spacecraft will carry the first space-borne P-band radar to deliver exceptionally accurate maps of tropical, temperate and boreal forest biomass that are not obtainable by ground-measurement techniques.
Copernicus and the Sentinel family
The largest provider of Earth observation data in the world, this European satellite programme focuses on improving environmental management, understanding and mitigating climate change effects, disaster and crisis management and ensuring civil security. Airbus-built Sentinels 2, 5P and 6 are currently in orbit. New satellites LSTM, CRISTAL and ROSE-L with its Airbus-built instrument, will launch as of 2027 to expand the current capabilities in key areas such as food security, irrigation and water scarcity.  
Discover the LSTM satellite
EarthCARE
This satellite, undergoing the last preparations before launch, will monitor the impact of clouds and tiny atmospheric particles (aerosols) on atmospheric radiation. Key focus areas will include investigating the interrelationships between clouds and precipitation, and their effects on radiation. 
Read more
MetOp-SG
This new generation of two satellites will provide continuity for meteorological measurements currently collected by in-orbit MetOp satellites. Improved spectral and spatial resolution measurements are among the enhancements in this second generation. 
Merlin
This satellite programme (a joint programme run by CNES and DLR) is set to study greenhouse gases and global warming. Merlin will use LIDAR to probe the atmosphere and determine the varying concentrations of methane. This gas, along with carbon dioxide, is one of the main contributors to the greenhouse effect. 
MicroCarb
This satellite, carrying an optical instrument built by Airbus, will launch the first European mission dedicated solely to measuring CO2 levels using a spectrometer at visible and near infrared wavelengths. This mission will complement Merlin.

Inclusion and diversity
Fostering a safe and inclusive workplace for all
Our commitment to inclusion and diversity
At Airbus, we recognise the power of diversity. It drives creativity, innovation and problem solving. From the front-line to the back-office, all of us can make an impact – our individual behaviours contribute to what we can achieve as a whole.
Our mission is to become a leading employer of choice, known not just for our products, but for our inclusive culture and diverse workforce. Together, we want to shape the future of aerospace, drawing strength from diverse perspectives and talents.
At Airbus, inclusion means celebrating and valuing diversity. We want all our employees – irrespective of their socio-economic background, age, race, ethnicity, physical ability, neurodiversity, gender, sexual orientation or any other characteristic – to feel valued, respected, included and heard. 
Our inclusion & diversity in figures
We have around 150,000 colleagues in 180 locations worldwide
150+ nationalities
20+ languages present within our company;
17% of our employees are from non-founding countries
20% of our workforce are women
26% of new hires were women in 2023;
We target hiring 33% women per year;
20% of executive positions held by women;
We aim for 25% of executive positions to be held by women by 2025
14 ERGs / ~10,000 volunteers worldwide
supporting different groups
Employee Resource Groups are internal self-organised and self-empowered communities bringing together individual volunteers in a safe and inclusive space
Our commitment
We want Airbus to reflect the diverse markets and communities we serve. By bringing together people from a wide range of backgrounds, and experiences, we learn from each other and collaborate more effectively while creating value for our customers, society and employees.
Susan Breton
Head of Inclusion and Diversity at Airbus
Diversity in action
Our initiatives
Female representation
Gender is at the heart of our strategy for achieving equity in our policies and practices, our employee experience, talent recruitment and retention.
We recognise that aerospace and defence are historically male-dominated industries, and we are committed to challenging that.
This is why we place a strong focus on promoting STEM careers among women through external partnerships and the support of employee resource groups – for example with Capital Filles, Women in Aviation, IAWA.  
Promoting gender parity is a top priority in our recruitment efforts. We are committed to facilitating the progression of women to leadership positions through our “Balance for Business” employee resource group. To foster pay equity, we are signatories to the UK Women in Aviation and Aerospace Charter, and we welcome the UK and French governments’ Gender Pay Gap Reports.
Social diversity
We believe our strength lies in the differences of our people. Employee Resource Groups such as EmBRACE in the UK and Full Spectrum in America foster racial diversity at Airbus. We have also signed charters that contribute to the economic and social development of underprivileged neighbourhoods. In 2023, 75 apprentices were able to take part in FlightPath9, an apprenticeship programme for under-represented communities in the United States. 
LGBTQ+
We have a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination of any kind. For us, every individual is unique and valuable. We are early adopters of the UN LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business which provide guidance on best practices to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the countries in which we operate. 
(Dis)ability
Disability is not a barrier at Airbus. We champion initiatives that promote equal opportunity. We also encourage dialogue and awareness of our people with (dis)abilities—both visible and non-visible disabilities.
To ensure an inclusive supply chain, Airbus partners with companies that work with disabled people across Europe.

Human rights
Our commitment to respecting human rights
Fundamental to responsible business conduct
Human rights are the basic rights that belong to every person no matter where they live, their nationality, colour, religion or other personal characteristics. Being part of a global industry employing more than 65 million people across the world, we have a responsibility to respect human rights and ensure that people are treated with dignity.
International human rights standards & principles
Our commitment
Our ambition is to embed and advance respect for human rights throughout our business, operations and supply chain, in relation to activities under our full, direct control.  
As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003, we are committed to upholding international human rights standards and principles, including:
the International Bill of Human Rights (comprising the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights)
the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and its eight Core Labour Standards
In doing so, we aim to implement policies and processes that respect applicable law in the countries in which we operate and take into account the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
Our Human Rights Policy Statement
Our Human Rights Policy Statement reflects our approach to respecting human rights. These commitments are being progressively embedded into our global organisation, including through the development of a directive supported by training and guidance, as well as a roadmap to drive our strategic action plan.
Key actions to support our human rights ambition are defined in our human rights roadmap which was developed following a human rights impact and gap analysis across our global business to more fully understand our potential human rights impacts.
This analysis, conducted with the help of specialist third-party human rights consultants, considered current and upcoming regulatory requirements and international best practices as well as international human rights principles and standards.
Human Rights Statement by Guillaume Faury
Human Rights Policy Statement
Assessing human rights risks
Our commitment
Our salient human rights issues were identified (see box below) through an assessment of impacts based on severity (scope, scale, irremediability), likelihood, relationship and level influence to inform prioritisation. They were verified through dialogue with both internal and external stakeholders.
Taking into account that salient issues may change over time, we are committed to reviewing them on a regular basis.
Risks related to the salient issues are recorded in the Enterprise Risk Management system and governance follows a similar process as the one existing for the Top Company Risks.  Each risk has  an owner and an action plan which is reviewed regularly, including by senior management.
Our approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Guided by a trustworthy AI agenda, we prioritise an ethics by design approach to AI, integrating respect for human rights and adherence to International Humanitarian Law (IHL), through the principles listed below
Safety first - Safety is our top priority, at the heart of everything we do. We ensure the highest standards of reliability and dependability to protect lives and property.
Wellbeing and sustainability - The AI systems we use should enhance societal wellbeing, expand our business, and promote a safe, united world. They also contribute to our sustainability goals by respecting the planet, valuing people and enabling prosperity.
Human agency and oversight - Human oversight of AI systems is essential. It includes the ability to understand, supervise, and control their design and operation, as well as the capacity to detect deviations from intended behaviour and override AI decisions when necessary. Airbus AI systems respect individuals' rights to independent thought, decision-making, and action.
Accountability and transparency - As stakeholders, providers, and deployers of AI systems, Airbus takes responsibility for their function and consequences. We achieve this by designing transparent and explainable systems.
Fairness - We believe in equal rights, opportunities, and fairness for all, without discrimination, and we support diversity and inclusion.
Data Privacy and Governance - Airbus adheres to strict data privacy and governance standards. 
Our approach to modern slavery
Modern slavery is a significant global issue that can affect every country, sector and industry. It can take many forms, such as human trafficking, forced and bonded labour and child labour. According to the Global Slavery Index, an estimated 40.3 million slaves exist in the world today. This includes approximately 10 million children. 
Since 2017, we have published a Modern Slavery Statement every year. This Statement sets out the steps we are taking to mitigate the risk of modern slavery in our business and supply chain including our subsidiaries and affiliates. It also includes the fundamental principles that govern the way we approach preventing modern slavery now and in the future.
Modern Slavery Statement 2023
Speaking up
We encourage anybody connected with our business activities to 'speak up' through various channels, including OpenLine. The OpenLine enables anybody who has a concern, including suppliers, to securely and confidentially submit an alert in good faith on potential issues, including those relating to bribery, human rights, environment, and health and safety.
Access OpenLine
Integrity & transparency throughout our supply chain
Because we outsource a significant part of our activities, our global supply chain is a fundamental part of our ecosystem. We believe the human rights of anyone who works for or with Airbus must be respected—regardless of their location anywhere in the world.  
Today, we promote integrity and transparency through our supply chain due diligence process. The objective of this process is to:
Identify social and environmental risks in our supplier base
Facilitate supplier self-assessments that measure our suppliers’ ability to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and standards
Conduct on-site assessments as required
Supplier Code of Conduct for all Airbus suppliers
Our Supplier Code of Conduct, based on the International Forum on Business Ethical Conduct (IFBEC) model, is the document of reference for our approach to responsible supplier management. The Code represents our group-wide values and principles in line with internationally recognised standards and conventions (such as OECD and ILO). 
Supplier Code of Conduct
We expect our suppliers to comply with the key values set out in the Code. We also expect our suppliers to cascade these principles throughout their supply chains. In addition to the Code, our suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which operations are managed and/or services provided. Regardless of where our suppliers are located, all business should be conducted in a manner compatible with the Code.
Some of the provisions in the Airbus Supplier Code of Conduct include the following topics: 
Compliance with laws
Anti-bribery and corruption
Anti-money laundering and tax evasion
Data protection
Fair competition 
Health and safety
Respect for human rights, including prohibition of child labour and human trafficking
Environmental protection
Product safety
Employment practices, including non-discrimination
Responsible mineral sourcing
To ensure the proper functioning of components within our products, the use of some minerals is necessary. These minerals include tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, which are commonly used in electronic components.
Our approach to responsible mineral sourcing includes the following actions:
We published a Responsible Mineral Policy, which details our engagement to improve safety and human rights conditions in the mineral supply chains. 
In 2019, we joined the Responsible Minerals Initiative, which aims to find cross-industry solutions to minimise social risks in mineral supply chains.

Enabling Prosperity
We unite cultures, connect economies and enable partnerships
We are profoundly aware of our responsibility to society and future generations.
We operate in a complex, interconnected ecosystem, where business integrity and collaboration is key to being able to drive prosperity and economic resilience.
Maximising our impact through collaboration
Driving sustainable aerospace
We contribute to a global industry that supports the livelihoods of millions of families. We support global stability and peacekeeping, and work collaboratively with others around the world to maximise our positive contribution to society.
We are passionate about driving sustainable aerospace. We advocate for progress that will make our industry more sustainable, and play an active role lobbying and educating through our membership of industry associations and coalitions like ATAG, ICCAIA, IATA, and ASD. We are also part of the advisory group of the World Economic Forum (WEF), working on the Space Sustainability Rating and are a founding member of the WEF First Movers Coalition.  
Our partnerships with airlines are also an important way that we can drive positive change in the industry. For example, we support solutions like Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACC) that will offset the impact of emissions during our transition to net zero.
Upholding the highest standards of integrity and compliance
Integrity and compliance
In order to invest in a sustainable future, our business needs to be economically resilient. Our ability to tackle climate change depends on our capacity to invest and take a long-term view. 
Maintaining business integrity throughout all our activities is non-negotiable; it is the right thing to do. We follow the highest ethics and compliance standards and aim to go beyond what’s mandatory by law. 
Our business operations are driven by the highest standards of ethics and compliance. We can only fix issues we know about so we encourage an active speak up culture where employees trust they can raise their concerns without fear of retaliation.

Supporting communities and creating a lasting positive impact
Community Impact
We support communities with a focus on the most vulnerable, the environment, and young people. Through our corporate giving, we  prioritise partnerships which listen and respond to community needs and support solutions which create lasting positive impact. 
Through the Airbus Foundation we have facilitated relief or goodwill flights to numerous destinations around the globe, transporting over 1,389 tonnes of aid between 2008-2021. Airbus-owned test aircraft, charter and customer aircraft (delivery flights) have been used for these humanitarian flights. Over 1,261 humanitarian helicopter flight hours have been donated to support disaster rescue and evacuation training.
Every year, the Airbus Foundation also delivers satellite imagery covering tens of thousands of square kilometres to support its partners involved in humanitarian aid and protecting the environment.

Community impact
Working together to support communities around the world
Supporting local communities
Airbus has a responsibility to society and future generations, and wants to make a positive social impact within communities all around the world.
We take a collective approach, bringing our business, the Airbus Foundation and our employees together to safeguard the future of our planet, support vulnerable communities and develop the future generation.
Maximising our positive impact requires a sustainable, equitable and measurable approach. We have three core channels that work together and allow us to coordinate our efforts in the most effective way, whilst upholding high standards of governance and due diligence.
Taking a collective approach to community impact
Pause

The priorities we support
Our community impact strategy is aligned with the Airbus purpose and our sustainability priorities, and supports our commitments to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). 
Our collective action is focused around three key areas where we believe we can add the most value: 
Supporting and developing vulnerable communities
Developing tomorrow’s leaders
Safeguarding the future of our planet
Through our corporate giving, we have prioritised partnerships which respond to specific community needs and create lasting positive impact. Examples include bringing renewable energy to off-grid rural communities in Colombia; securing access to early education opportunities for children from underserved communities in the Philippines; and rejuvenating two lakes in Manesar and Bengaluru (India) to enable biodiversity restoration in these local areas.

Sustainability standards and performance
A transparent approach to sustainability performance reporting
Our approach to sustainability reporting
Being a responsible business means balancing the needs and expectations of society with our commitments to our business and our stakeholders. Reporting on our sustainability performance helps us to consider our impact on a range of issues and provides useful context to benchmark our activities.
We report against a range of highly-respected, globally-recognised standards to ensure a best-in-class approach, and we rely on our sustainability strategy and commitments to guide us in our responsible business practices.
The standards we measure ourselves against
Airbus measures its progress on sustainability against strict criteria codified in globally-recognised and highly-respected frameworks and standards. We approach our reporting from a standpoint of accuracy and transparency, and were the first aircraft manufacturer to disclose Scope 3 figures for the aircraft that we deliver to our customers.
We have been a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since December 2020. In addition, in 2022 we committed to having our near-term greenhouse gas emissions targets assessed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets were approved by the SBTi in early 2023.
At Airbus, we're committed to applying strong principles to how we conduct our business and to challenging ourselves to go further in mitigating our environmental impact because we believe we can, and should, raise the bar on what’s possible in sustainability in our industry. 
(Guillaume Faury, CEO Airbus)
Science Based Targets initiative
SBTi
Established in 2015, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) helps companies to set emissions-reduction targets in line with climate science and the Paris Agreement goals. More than 4,000 companies have joined the initiative since its inception.
In 2022, Airbus officially committed to define science-based targets for the entire set of its emissions. The following near-term targets were submitted to the SBTi for assessment and were validated in early 2023. All reduction targets are based on 2015 as baseline year:
Scopes 1 & 2: -63% absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and neutralisation of residual emissions
Scope 3: -46% greenhouse gas emissions intensity generated by its commercial aircraft in service by 2035
Find out more about our emissions targets:
Scope 1 & 2Scope 3
Other initiatives
Airbus has been a signatory since 2003. Our sustainability commitments are aligned with and support the UN SDGs, a global call to action to ensure a more sustainable future for people and the planet by 2030. We were among the first in our industry to formally adopt the SDGs as a framework for our social responsibility practices.
UN Global Compact
Airbus also links its sustainability information to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) disclosure framework for aerospace and defence companies, a recognised standard that outlines industry-specific ESG metrics.
SASB
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
As a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2020, Airbus’ approach to addressing climate risks and opportunities follows the four pillars of the TCFD: governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets.
TCFD

Airbus Foundation
Humanitarian support
Supporting emergency responders
Supporting emergency responders
The Airbus Foundation is an established, respected and recognised partner in emergency response among the humanitarian community, providing a range of product and service support.
Our emergency response support includes:
Air transport with Airbus flight test and charter aircraft for emergency relief flights and goodwill ferry flights with Airbus customers.
Helicopter transport with Airbus operators for emergency relief flights (Search & Rescue, Helicopter Emergency Medical System, Fire-fighting…)
Airbus satellite imagery for assessment before, during and after major natural disasters and crises worldwide, including  environmental support
Training of health professionals in helicopter emergency medicine in emerging countries
Commercial Aircraft
The Airbus Foundation’s humanitarian work is made possible through its partnerships and collaboration with key humanitarian actors. It is a strategic choice to work with organisations who bring expertise across the humanitarian response cycle. This approach also guarantees reach and impact,  permitting a certain stability and comfort by working with known organisations on a long term basis.
Helicopters
During the very first hours of a crisis, helicopters are able to make a very strong difference and enable a swift response. Their flexibility and ability to quickly be mobilised allows them to save lives and safely carry passengers in demanding environments, as well as support ground rescuers to assess emergency situations.
Moreover, the Airbus Foundation, in partnership with the FAM (Fondation de l’Academie de Medecine), contributes to the organization of rescue and  medical training in a helicopter environment.  Doctors and rescuer-workers are continuously trained  to ensure the development of Emergency Medical Services around the world.
Satellite imagery
The Airbus Foundation is providing satellite imagery to support the assessment of the humanitarian sector for major natural disasters and crises worldwide. Thanks to satellite images and their analysis, emergency responders and disaster relief organisations are able to map out areas that might be difficult to access, assess how severe the damage is and coordinate the actions of their staff, both on the ground and in the air.
A dedicated satellite portal, providing free of charge access to satellite imagery to selected partners with whom we have entered into partnerships, was opened by the Foundation as a sign of long term commitment to the humanitarian community. Some of the partners have also requested training on the analysis of satellite imagery to build their skills and competencies.
Our activities in Haiti and Nepal exemplify how the coordination of the company wide resources under the Airbus Foundation and the partnership with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement can have profound effects.
Contributions from all businesses helped the Foundation’s relief efforts following the refugee crisis in South Sudan (flight to Uganda in March 2017), hurricane Matthew in Haiti (October 2016) and the 7.9 magnitude earthquake in Nepal (April 2015).
Airbus organised relief flights with delivery aircraft,Airbus Helicopters provided helicopter-based solutions to affected areas, and Airbus Defence and Space used satellite imagery to help assess the extent of the damage.
The Airbus Foundation brings added value to Emergency Responders
The Airbus Foundation partners with global experts, solidifying its role as a leader in international humanitarian aid.

Youth development
Inspiring through science and aeronautics
Inspiring through science and aeronautics
The Foundation works to inspire and help young people to develop a curiosity to learn, to want to stay in school and to contribute as constructive global citizens.
In fact, it embraces the UN SDG 4 (United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4) , ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education. It invests in the future of the communities we support, sharing with children aged 8 to 18 from disadvantaged backgrounds our passion for STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - and aeronautics.. We want to demonstrate that STEM is an interesting topic, it can be fun, and it is close to everyone’s daily life. 
Working together
To achieve its goals, the Foundation relies on 30 partners and NGOs, providing their awareness and expertise of the local needs, to deploy Airbus Foundation Discovery Space (AFDS) programmes in 19 countries with the support of Airbus volunteers when possible. To deliver the programmes, the Foundation provides inspirational material and tools for hard and soft skills - digital and analogue content - available on the Airbus Foundation Discovery Space platform.
It also partners with key stakeholders (ESA and Autodesk) on the Moon Camp Challenge to foster an opportunity for teams of young people across the world to enter a global STEM challenge.
Airbus Foundation Discovery Space
The Airbus Foundation is reaching thousands of young people every year to inspire and encourage them to work towards their aspirations. Through the Discovery Space platform, we look forward to giving access to even more with fun and engaging STEM content.
The Airbus Foundation Discovery Space adresses 3 categories of ages :
Discover (8–12 y.o.): animations and booklets going through 3 main topics - Mission to the Moon, Science of Flight, and Future of the Skies
Experiment (12–14 y.o.): experience videos supporting some learning scenarios created by our partners.
Inspire (14–18 y.o.): A self-development booklet, to be used individually or with an educator/mentor, addressing topics self-care, collaboration, tackling misinformation, biases, cybersecurity, engagement, etc..   
The Youth development programmes are deployed in several countries all around the world, with the support of NGOs.

Environmental action
Positively supporting action on climate change and nature conservation
Addressing a major challenge
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time. The Airbus Foundation Environment pillar is created to help address this challenge, in line with the Company’s key priorities.
A top-level commitment
With its Environment pillar, the Airbus Foundation aims to join forces with the Connected Conservation Foundation to help preserve wildlife and natural ecosystems by sharing technologies and resources. Airbus’ high-resolution satellite imagery combined with the on-the-ground digital technologies of the Connected Conservation Foundation, help protect threatened species and stop habitat degradation.
The Airbus Foundation also provides imagery from the Pléiades and SPOT Earth resources satellites to the Global Logistic Cluster to help assess the impact of cyclones, hurricanes and flooding in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Supporting our partners
In close collaboration with its existing and new non-governmental organisation (NGO) partners, the Airbus Foundation provides NGO partners with products and services in support of:
Climate change mitigation and monitoring, assessing the impact and evolution of climate change, monitoring the restoration of nature and biodiversity via wildlife and forest monitoring and restoration;
Climate change adaptation and disaster prevention, hand-in-hand with the Airbus Foundation’s humanitarian activities, to assess areas prone to natural disasters, and support preparedness and capacity building of vulnerable environments and societies;
Minimising the environmental impact of human beings, improving and monitoring resource management with such activities as wetland monitoring, crop management, water use monitoring, and anti-poaching.

People safety
Airbus wants to be a company where the safety, health and wellbeing of people is valued as an integral part of our business sustainability.
At Airbus we pioneer aerospace for a safe and united world. Safety of our employees and others is our top priority. We are committed to pursuing the highest standards of health and safety.

To achieve this goal, we have adopted the principles of the International Standard, ISO 45001 for our management system and we are fostering a culture in which we all take responsibility for our own health and safety, and that of others. This means that leadership, responsibility and action are needed at all levels of the company. We also promote employee involvement and a speak-up culture to ensure that health and safety standards are continuously improved.

We aspire to zero harm.
Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer
Health and Safety key principles
 The Airbus Occupational Health and Safety policy contains the principles that drive a continuous focus on health and safety performance improvement, with priorities and initiatives that include:
 The identification and management of risk to people and the business that could arise from our work activities.
The application of the principles of the International Standard, ISO 45001 for our management system.
The development of a ‘respect and protect’ culture in which everyone feels responsible for the health and safety of themselves and others.
Airbus aspires to be a ‘zero harm’ company, where the safety, health and wellbeing of people is valued as an integral part of our success. We recognise that improving the quality of life for people and the efficiency of our company go hand-in-hand.
Our commitments to responsible health and safety management are also contained in the Airbus Code of Conduct, and details of our actions can be found in each annual Airbus Registration document.
Health and Safety Risk Management
 The management of risks arising from our work activities is key, and Airbus has company-wide standards to ensure that risks are identified, assessed, mitigated and, if necessary, escalated.  Standards also exist for the reporting, investigation and management of incidents, to ensure that lessons are learned and improvements are made.
 
Airbus ensures full compliance with applicable rules and procedures. We encourage employee involvement and a speak-up culture, as well as incident reporting. Health and safety awareness is supported by dedicated communication campaigns and training.
 
Collaborative working is strongly encouraged. For example, medical, industrial hygiene and safety experts worked together with other functions to define and coordinate the necessary measures to cope with the Covid 19 pandemic.
Health and Wellbeing support
 Airbus believes that wellbeing is key to good health and employee engagement, which is the foundation on which to build company culture and productivity. Wellbeing is more than merely the absence of poor health or physical harm. 
 
Multidisciplinary occupational health teams that include doctors and nurses, psychologists and other specialists ensure appropriate advice and support is available to employees. These wellbeing programs and resources are a critical element in the particular circumstances of the current pandemic.

Safety of our products
The Airbus safety culture drives the design and operations of our full product range – backed by continuous technological improvements
We foster an open reporting culture within Airbus that encourages employees to speak up about any potential safety concerns in an atmosphere of trust and empowerment. We reinforce the safety culture with our people through safety promotion and training.
This culture is driven by our highest priority: to always keep safety first. It is our mission to protect the safety of our fleet for everyone who is flying on board, using, or operating an Airbus product. This is why a Chief Product Safety Officer is appointed as an independent voice for safety in Airbus Commercial Aircraft, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence & Space. Each Chief Product Safety Officer reports directly to the highest levels in the company and ensures that the appropriate safety governance is in place to achieve our safety mission.
The corporate Safety Management System (SMS) is how we anticipate, manage, and mitigate safety risks to ensure the safe operation of our products and services. We proactively share our years of experience with counterparts at industry level. The SMS is facilitated by an appointed Corporate SMS Officer, as well as SMS officers per function – with support from a network of nominated SMS representatives throughout the company. The Safety Management System principle is also shared at the interface with our Airbus suppliers and customers/operators.

Product safety for commercial aircraft
We are committed to exceeding industry safety standards and supporting the safe operation of all our commercial aircraft and for those who fly aboard them.
 This takes operational experience into account, drawing lessons learned and implementing necessary changes – extending beyond the products themselves into the training provided for flight, cabin, and maintenance crews, along with the worldwide services delivered in support of aircraft operations.
Beyond this, we are in constant contact with other aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and air safety organisations around the world to find new ways of improving safety standards. We believe that industry-wide cooperation is crucial to making further safety enhancements.
Our safety culture
 Product safety drives us to raise standards and prevent accidents. Our dedication to product safety is demonstrated through our common value of always putting safety first. We are committed to reinforcing our safety culture with our people through safety promotion and training. 
We foster an open reporting culture where employees are encouraged to speak up about any potential safety concerns in an atmosphere of trust and empowerment. This is reflected in the Airbus Commitment to Just & Fair Culture, which is signed by the Airbus CEO, Executive Committee members, and top managers. It includes the commitment to ensure the appropriate reporting channels are available and known to all employees to report product safety and quality related matters in an atmosphere of trust and empowerment.
Safety in design
 Product safety drives us to raise standards and prevent accidents. We ensure safety in the design of aircraft and the quality of manufacturing and support, the materials and manuals supplied to customers to operate and maintain the aircraft, the training provided to flight, cabin, and maintenance crews, and the worldwide services delivered in support of aircraft operations. We go beyond airworthiness requirements to also focus on safety enhancement activities in our products and services and implementing safety enhancements when appropriate.
Safety in technology
 The air transport industry has achieved step changes in safety, underlining the significant contribution of technology to make flying safer than ever before. This is demonstrated by the continual decrease in the overall accident rate for commercial air transport.
Each new generation of aircraft has introduced technology that helps to prevent the main causes of accidents. One example of an Airbus technological breakthrough is digital fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. Introduced in 1988 with the A320 Family, fly-by-wire flight controls bring improved handling and enhanced safety – including protection that prevents an aircraft from exceeding its approved flight envelope, helping to reduce loss of control in-flight accidents. An additional benefit is operational commonality for pilots across the Airbus range of aircraft products, from the single-aisle A320 Family to the widebody A330, A340, A350 and A380.
The flight management systems and electronic navigation displays introduced in cockpits in the 1980s significantly improved navigation performance and position awareness. The Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) is another example of a technology that has significantly enhanced safety. These technological advances have been key to reducing controlled flight into terrain accidents.
We support Airbus Operators in their efforts to reduce the risk of runway excursion accidents. Runway Overrun Prevention System (ROPS) is an avionic alerting system designed to prevent runway overrun during the landing phase. ROPS was introduced on the A380 aircraft in 2009 and is now standard on all new Airbus aircraft. RunwaySense is another technology that improves runway safety. This web-based platform enables airlines and airports to assess and report runway conditions in real-time, using the aircraft as a sensor.
Airbus Safety Promotion Centre
The number one priority of Airbus is the continued safe transport of everyone and everything that flies aboard an Airbus product.
Learn how the Safety Promotion Centre encourages a deeper personal engagement of our employees with safety and cultivates an accident prevention mindset.

Safety Risk Management
 As a key component of the Airbus Corporate SMS, the management of risks associated with identified hazards from collected safety data enables data-driven decision making and supports a proactive approach to manage safe operations of products and services.
Applying proactive risk management principles has contributed to significant improvements for the safety of flight in recent decades. This risk management approach drives our Corporate Safety Process, which has been in place for more than 15 years. It supports the principles of the Airbus safety enhancement culture, going beyond compliance with certification and airworthiness duties.
Safety compliance
 Product certifications are provided by aviation authorities. We work to ensure compliance through design and certification of products under EASA Part 21 Design Organisation Approvals (DOA), manufacturing under Production Organisation Approvals (POA), monitoring of in-service safety through approved EASA Part-M Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisations (CAMO); aircraft maintenance and retrofit operations conducted in line with civil and military EASA Part 145 regulations; and training provided to flight crews, cabin crews and maintenance crews through EASA Part 147 Approved Training Organisations (ATO).
The certified organisations within Airbus where specific approvals are granted by the aviation authorities, are audited and monitored by these authorities to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Additional audits are conducted by third parties as part of the quality certifications including EN9100, EN9001, EN9110, AQAP 2110, AQAP 2210 and AQAP 2310.

Product safety for defence
Airbus Defence and Space has implemented the Safety Management System (SMS) strategy for its military aircraft and unmanned aerial systems programmes to increase the safety of company’s products, reducing the number of incidents.  
 The very nature of military operations and humanitarian missions entail exposure to risks greater than in commercial air operations. However, the prevention of accidents and incidents are among Airbus’ key activities for defence, with its related projects framed into the SMS and deployed through the company as part of the safety risk management process.
In addition to the reports received from operators, one of the sources for potential safety hazards identification are the voluntary reports coming from employees. Airbus Defence and Space fosters an open reporting culture where employees are encouraged to report any potential safety hazard, event, or concern, reflected in the company’s Commitment to Just & Fair Culture, which is signed by the CEO, along with Executive Committee members and top managers.
Airbus Defence and Space analyses every reported safety event to provide solutions that enhance the safety of the Airbus military aircraft products. The company’s proactive risk management approach supports the principles of the Airbus safety enhancement culture, going beyond with certification, airworthiness, and product regulatory compliance duties.
The safety information and lessons learned are shared with the industry, customers, and operators through safety workshops.
Safety in design and technology
 Airbus Defence and Space continuously takes on the challenge of improving the design of its wide range of products to make them safer – as demonstrated by the continuous technological advances of its products, such as:
Eurofighter carefree handling
 The Eurofighter Typhoon’s “carefree” handling concept is a mandatory requirement for the flight control laws to reduce pilot workload for this front-line combat aircraft. With carefree handling, the flight control system allows any pilot input while protecting against exceedance of the aircraft’s structural and aerodynamic limits, as well as simultaneously maximising aircraft performance. It includes an automatic recovery mode that can be initiated by the pilot in the event of spatial disorientation.
A330 MRTT Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS):
 In-flight refuelling of military aircraft is among the most demanding missions – requiring tanker and receiver pilots to operate in close formation with aircraft of varying flight characteristics and speeds, during day-and-night and all-weather conditions, and potentially in hostile airspace above the battlefield. The Aerial Refuelling Boom System (ARBS) on Airbus’ A300 Multi Role Tanker Transport is the first new-generation, fly-by-wire system for in-flight refuelling in service today, providing more rapid and simpler operations through more responsive controls and boom disconnection systems.
Airbus has now taken the A330 MRTT and its ARBS one step further with automatic in-flight refuelling, based on image processing to determine the receiver’s refuelling receptacle position. Initiated at the “simple” push of a button, it reduces the air refuelling operator’s workload, improves safety, and optimises the rate of air-to-air fuel transfers in operational conditions to maximise aerial superiority.
A400M low level flight and enhanced vision:
 As the most advanced multi-role military transport aircraft, Airbus’ A400M has a fully managed low-level function that flies a safe 3D trajectory in close proximity to the ground. Additionally, it enables instrument flight in low visibility conditions. Also incorporated on the A400M is a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) enhanced vision system (EVS) camera that provides an improved terrain view in low-visibility conditions.

Product safety for helicopters
The technological leadership of Airbus directly supports the safe operation of the company’s rotorcraft in missions around the world.
 From cutting-edge aircraft design to state-of-the-art systems and displays, Airbus has developed a reputation for constant innovation that aims to incorporate the latest advances in safety on its rotary-wing aircraft.
Aircraft design
Fenestron® shrouded tail rotor
One of the most distinctive features of Airbus helicopters is the Fenestron® shrouded tail rotor. Developed by Airbus in the 1960s, the Fenestron® introduced a new level of helicopter safety on the ground and in the air – and is incorporated today on the H130, H135, H145, H155 and H160 helicopters. In addition to shielding ground personnel from hazards posed by a traditional spinning rotor and protecting the rotor blades within its “fantail” design, the Fenestron® provides additional control efficiency for the rotorcraft and reduces the demand for power in forward flight.
Main rotor hubs
At the heart of Airbus helicopter main rotor designs are the bearingless concepts like Starflex, Spheriflex and BMR (Bearingless Main Rotor) architectures. They ensure very fast responses to pitch changes while also offering excellent manoeuvrability and stability. Used across Airbus’ rotorcraft product line, they are practically maintenance-free and have a fail-safe design through the application of composite materials
Crashworthy seats
Crashworthy seats on Airbus helicopters are designed to absorb a portion of the crash energy that would otherwise be transmitted to the occupant. They are equipped with a four-point safety belt system, and the harness restraint system incorporates an automatic inertial reel and a device for manual locking of the shoulder belts.
 Systems and displays
  Helionix®
 The Helionix® system is an advanced avionics suite from Airbus that offers unrivalled pilot assistance in an intuitive human-machine interface, thereby improving overall safety through reduced pilot workload and unique flight envelope protection.
Featuring high levels of redundancy with the latest technology cockpit displays, Helionix® offers an innovative alerting system, extensive self-monitoring functions and an on-demand vehicle monitoring display, as well as Airbus’ dual-duplex 4-axis Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) featuring functions specifically developed for helicopter flight operations. 
For enhanced situational awareness, Helionix® integrates features such as digital maps, the Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning System (HTAWS), synthetic vision systems and more. Airbus’ state-of-the-art Helionix® avionics is standard on the latest -generation twin H175 and H160, as well as the multi-role twin-engined H145 and H135.
The Eye for Autonomous Guidance and Landing Extension (Eagle)
 Airbus is developing an experimental on-board image processing management system aimed at performing automatic approaches and landings in challenging conditions. The Eye for Autonomous Guidance and Landing Extension system, or Eagle, feeds all of a helicopter’s image processing functions into the avionics system, thus improving the crew’s situational awareness and reducing the pilot’s workload.
Vehicle and engine multifunction display
 The Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display (VEMD) is an Airbus development for the management and control of primary parameters for the helicopter and engine. It reduces pilot workload and fosters a “heads-up” approach to flying – giving the pilot more time to focus on the external environment through a quick and easy scan, excellent visibility and optimised ergonomics. The VEMD is integrated on Airbus EC120, H125, H130, AS355, H135, H145, H155, H160, H175, H215 and H225 helicopter versions.
Image recorder camera flight data monitoring system
 The image recording device collects inertial and positioning data, ambient acoustic data and cockpit imagery, which are stored on a crash-hardened memory module, as well as a removable secure digital card. This information is processed internally for use in Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) and flight training.
This device is also critical in supporting accident investigations – helping Airbus to construct its innovative Enhanced Virtual Environment (EVE) that provides investigators with a virtual pilots-eye view of what happened, which helps to prevent other accidents.
Supply chain
 Airbus Helicopters works with its supply chain partners to leverage the strengths of this global network through a collaborative approach and shared view on safety and customer expectations.
This ensures that the company’s commitment to safety is aligned throughout the entire aircraft manufacturing process, to deliver quality aircraft that meet – and exceed – the requirements of a global operator base.

Product safety for space
From the production of spacecraft and satellites to their orbiting, operation and subsequent disposal after mission completion, Airbus is committed to designing safe systems.
  Reducing the risks from space assets
 Space debris is a major threat to the future of space operations in Earth orbit – from human spaceflight to the use of satellites for telecommunications relay, internet connectivity, scientific research, and observation of the planet.
Airbus is pursuing clean-up solutions that range from modules and sails that can deorbit spacecraft at the end of their useful lives to nets and harpoons that capture space junk and non-responsive satellites. Such technologies were demonstrated during 2018-2019 with the RemoveDEBRIS orbiting platform, which was designed, built, and manufactured by a consortium of companies that included Airbus.
In addition, Airbus satellites are designed with the necessary equipment and propellant to “clean” the orbit and not leave debris behind. Spacecraft are deliberately manoeuvred to burn up upon re-entry into the atmosphere – or are sent into graveyard orbit where no other satellites can cross their path. When re-entering the atmosphere, the trajectory is controlled so that potential spacecraft debris impacts uninhabited regions of Earth (usually the southeast Pacific Ocean region), to prevent any human casualties. 
Providing safety through space assets
 Space assets are key contributors to safety on Earth. From climate monitoring and the understanding of phenomena that disturb our planet, to using remote sensing in order to plan and manage humanitarian or natural crisis operations, to safe navigation and landing of airplanes, Earth would not be as safe as it is today without space assets.
The quality of weather prediction relies largely on meteorological satellites made by Airbus. Additionally, the company’s space systems for defence communication contribute daily to the protection of populations all over the world.
In the future, space technology will have the capability to change the trajectory of asteroids long before they cross the Earth’s path – a catastrophic threat for life and the planet’s climate. Airbus is participating in studies that will make such planetary defence systems feasible.

Space safety in operations
Satellites are primarily launched into orbit using rockets, and these spacecraft are expected to be operational during lifetimes that can easily reach 15 years. Additionally, they increasingly are required to be in a status to be able to dispose of themselves safely at the mission’s end.
Safety from launch operations to disposal at end-of-life 
 By leading the launch services market for decades through the development of Ariane launchers, Airbus has played an important role in launching satellites into Earth orbit and beyond for deep space exploration. Today, the company maintains its presence in this sector through its participation in ArianeGroup – the joint venture of Airbus and Safran.
Manufacturing and utilisation of large launch vehicles requires the strictest measures of safety. Occupational safety is a top priority for the Ariane launch base, located at the Guiana Space Centre in South America. ArianeGroup applies specific management and preventive measures to provide a safe work environment at the launch facility. This includes strict procedures for the handling of Ariane launchers and their propellant – from launch vehicle processing to the lift-off and ascent, along with training to keep all employees and subcontractors abreast of health and safety regulations.
To ensure that risks are minimised, no operation is performed without a preliminary safety analysis. Risk prevention measures include the wearing of appropriate personal protective equipment during preparation of both the launcher and its spacecraft payloads. The measures also include clearly determined procedures in the handling of hazardous materials for the propulsion systems that are used in the launchers and their payloads.
During launch, predetermined launch tracks and strict range safety procedures ensure that potential failures of the launcher will not create damage on the ground.
When orbit has been reached, the satellite payloads are separated from the launch vehicle’s upper stage in such a way as to prevent collision with other objects in orbit. 
For each flight, the Ariane launcher’s mission ends with the controlled re-entry of all stages through the atmosphere.  
Furthermore, in partnership with the French CNES space agency, specific procedures are implemented to prevent launches at moments that may pose a threat of collision with other celestial bodies for spacecraft on escape trajectories from Earth orbit. This is aligned with the planetary protection policy of COSPAR (the Committee on Space Research). 
ArianeGroup and Airbus work closely with the European Space Agency to ensure that environmental protection measures for launchers and satellites are integrated beginning at the initial design stage. 
Monitoring the trajectory of debris and active spacecraft and manoeuvring around these objects helps to prevent collisions through dual goals of avoiding the loss of valuable spacecraft and preventing the creation of new space debris that can endanger further missions. 
The design of satellites for reliable and fail-safe operations – with an option of safe passivation or active de-orbiting at mission end – is an additional means to help ensure Airbus products do not contribute to space debris.

Safety investigation
At Airbus, safety remains the top priority for all our products. To achieve this, we put the focus on preventing or minimising safety-related incidents/accidents through innovative technologies, enhanced operations, and strong teamwork. 
 When an accident occurs, Airbus has established strong and transparent processes on how to respond and provide appropriate support to safety investigation authorities – as well as applying the lessons learned to further improve safety and avoid future incidents/accidents.
As a manufacturer, Airbus has an important role to play in bringing new technologies with safety benefits into operational use. We have marked many key achievements while supporting safety investigation agencies over the years – leading to advances in design and maintenance, training, operations, and safety management. 
Providing expertise

When an aircraft accident/incident involves a civil aircraft or rotorcraft, independent Safety Investigation Authorities (SIAs) must launch an investigation to collect and analyse evidence to determine the circumstances and the certain or likely causes of the accident or incident. The purpose of these investigations established by international aviation standards  is to draw lessons learned with a view to prevent a recurrence.
During these investigations Airbus primarily serves in an advisory role in accordance with international law and the established aviation industry protocols involving aircraft manufacturers, equipment suppliers and the international aviation agencies. Airbus stands ready to provide the company’s expertise and resources in supporting the independent safety investigation agencies for their gathering, recording and analysis of all relevant information. 
The immediate response to a serious incident / accident by Airbus may involve the deployment of competent company personnel – who are on standby status – to assist in data collection at the site, with subsequent evaluations that make use of the company’s laboratories, simulators, and other technical resources around the world under the supervision of SIAs.
Selected Airbus specialists – trained to work on an incident/accident site while adhering to the necessary protocols – may be nominated to support an investigation.
Analysing the situation
 Airbus can dispatch a “Go Team” within a few hours after being notified of a serious incident/accident. The composition of a group and timing is adapted to the specific event and location.
The role of specialists on the “Go Team” is to assist the Airbus lead investigator and provide technical support to the appointed safety investigation agency  in order to help identifying, preserving, and recovering evidence from the incident/accident site. Airbus personnel will stay the full amount of time needed to complete their mission, and as long as the safety investigation authorities require their expertise.
Once data has been collected, Airbus works in support of the investigation authorities, making its resources available for in-depth analyses covering multiple domains – from manufacturing, engineering and operations, to training, maintenance, human factors and beyond. This assistance is highly valued in identifying the circumstances of the concerned event, understanding their cause(s) and defining steps that can eliminate or avoid them in the future.
Understanding safety investigations
 International aviation standards established  safety investigation as an independent  process with the purpose of accident and incident prevention, which includes the gathering and analysis of factual information, the drawing of conclusions, including the determination of causes and/or contributing factors and – when appropriate – the making of safety recommendations.
The main objective of the safety investigation of an accident or incident is the prevention of accidents and incidents, and never apportion blame or liability. The accident investigation authority should have independence in the conduct of the investigation and have unrestricted authority over its conduct.

Becoming an Airbus Supplier
Partner with us to shape the future of sustainable aerospace
Suppliers belong to our extended family
A global network
Airbus’ partners and suppliers are part of our extended family, each playing a crucial role in our joint success.
Around 80% of the value of our products are sourced from the supplier market, partnering with over 18 000 suppliers worldwide at group level including controlled affiliates.
Airbus’ external sourcing volume in 2023 amounted to €53 billion.
Airbus Procurement activities are organised depending on the type of products or services bought. We distinguish :
- Direct procurement, grouped by commodities for flying parts (raw materials, structures, systems & equipments, cabin products, engines)
- Indirect procurement, managed by Airbus General Procurement, covers the acquisition of non-flying parts and services, crucial for our operations.
Procurement is the interface between Airbus and the supply base, securing suppliers’ on-time on-quality deliveries and developing suppliers' maturity.
Join our expansive network to shape the future of aerospace with us.

Vulnerability disclosure guidelines
Safety and security of products, services or assets made by or belonging to Airbus are of utmost importance in our industry. We welcome any reports of potential vulnerabilities related to our products, services or assets that you may submit in good faith and in accordance with these guidelines. 
IMPORTANT: If you are a customer, supplier or contractor of AIRBUS products or services you should contact your Airbus business point directly rather than use this process. 
 Safety First! 
AIRBUS is strongly committed to safety and security and therefore urges you to not do anything that could harm and damage yourself or others. 
 How to report?
Send your English language report by encrypted email (please use the Airbus PGP public key) to: vuln@airbus.com as soon as possible after the discovery of the potential vulnerability together with the following information: 
Description of the vulnerability;
Details to reproduce;
Discovery timeline;
Related product, service or asset;
Your contact details including your PGP key.
We will acknowledge receipt of your report in a timely manner, usually within 72h. If you do not receive any acknowledgement receipt from Airbus within this timeframe, please re-submit your report to ensure we have received it. 
 What’s about trust? 
We may need time to assess and fix any vulnerability. We rely on you to provide us with reasonable time before sharing or publishing any potential vulnerabilities to the public or third parties. Please keep in mind that any public disclosure or sharing of information concerning any unresolved vulnerability may cause harm and expose your responsibility. 
We respect the interests of the reporting party and anonymous reports are welcome. 
Note: AIRBUS does not operate a bug bounty program. We do, however, recognize reporting parties who have brought an acknowledged security vulnerability to our attention. AIRBUS is working to set up a public Hall of Fame. Only reporting parties who express a wish and authorization to be named will be listed in the Hall of Fame. 
 Be ethical and compliant! 
The purpose of these guidelines is to ease the disclosure of potential vulnerabilities in an ethical way and in accordance with the law. They shall not be construed as a permission to infringe any law or to reverse engineer any code or other technology. 
Disclosure of any vulnerability will comply with the following principles: 
Do not cause any harm to AIRBUS, our customers, suppliers, partners or any other individuals or companies; 
Do not act so as to compromise safety of our products, their operation and/or related services; 
Do not infringe any applicable intellectual property rights or trade secrets, laws or regulations; 
Do not lock, disclose, destroy or compromise integrity of Airbus’ and Airbus’ customers and partners’ data; 
Do not turn a financial transaction into a precondition to the disclosure of potential vulnerability; 
Do not breach any applicable data privacy laws and regulations.

What our customers say
Our services are recommended by industry experts just like you
See all testimonials
I am very satisfied with the work accomplished by Airbus in less than 4 months. You managed to deliver a really immersive system to CFAA in time and in quality, and I appreciate the good understanding of our needs.
French Ministry of Defence
Through our joint collaboration over the past couple of years, Airbus has provided timely, high quality satellite imagery so that we can help farmers and ag retailers identify issues within 24-28 hours after collection – which is a critical time for making crop production management decisions. With the combination of imagery and Intelinair's data analytics, AGMRI detects and alerts our customers of any issues with stand count establishment and crop health. With these insights, farmers and ag retailers can identify which fields to scout and where exactly to go in the field to then take actions to help protect yield potential and improve efficiency on their farm operations.

We achieved strong order intake across all businesses in 2024, with a book-to-bill well above 1, confirming the solid demand for our products and services. We delivered on our 2024 guidance in what was a testing year for Airbus. We refocused our efforts on key priorities, notably the production ramp-up and the transformation of Defence and Space. We continue to pursue profitable growth and our decarbonisation ambition. The 2024 financial results and the level of confidence we have in our future performance support our proposal for an increased dividend.

Airbus Full-Year (FY) 2024 financial results
At a glance
We achieved strong order intake across all businesses in 2024, with a book-to-bill well above 1, confirming the solid demand for our products and services. We delivered on our 2024 guidance in what was a testing year for Airbus. We refocused our efforts on key priorities, notably the production ramp-up and the transformation of Defence and Space. We continue to pursue profitable growth and our decarbonisation ambition. The 2024 financial results and the level of confidence we have in our future performance support our proposal for an increased dividend.
