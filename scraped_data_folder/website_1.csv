Action to reach climate positive emissions by 2040. Siemens Gamesa achieved carbon neutrality in late 2019 and has its climate targets verified by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). However, we want to go further. We are going beyond carbon neutrality and aim to become climate positive by 2040, meaning that by this stage we will be removing more CO2 from the atmosphere than we emit.
We will achieve this through a combination of actions such as microalgae that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere to hydrogen-powered reach stackers, or the commitment to phasing out the greenhouse gas SF6 and other F-gases by 2030. 
Action to make our supply chain sustainable. At Siemens Gamesa, we are proud of our internal journey to carbon neutrality, and it is great to see that many suppliers are striving to reduce their impact on the environment and put in place long-term sustainable practices. The next step is to encourage these positive changes across the value chain, which is why we have developed a comprehensive framework integrating our supplier’s sustainability performance into our supplier selection and development processes.
Action to deliver a fully recyclable turbine by 2040. In 2021, Siemens Gamesa developed the world’s first recyclable wind turbine blade. One year later, the first ever commercial installation of recyclable blades took place at RWE’s Kaskasi offshore wind power project, and just one month after that the onshore model of the recyclable blade was ready for commercial use too. The RecyclableBlade is the first step towards our goal of delivering a fully recyclable turbine by 2040, ensuring that all materials in the turbine can be recycled. It is Siemens Gamesa’s goal to develop innovative and efficient technology to power the green transition, but it is also our responsibility to ensure that this technology’s lifecycle does not end when the blades stop spinning.
Action to become a better employer. We strive to be a socially responsible employer and to embed ethical behaviors across all our business activities and value chain. We do this by promoting and maintaining an ethical and transparent work environment in which employees’ best interests are protected. The safety and wellbeing of our employees is of utmost importance, and we are constantly looking for new ways to enhance them in our company and across the entire industry. Furthermore, we know that having a diverse workforce makes us more innovative and competitive, which is why we’ve pledged to increase female representation in the workforce to 30% by 2040, developed an inclusive parental policy and are actively promoting LGBTI diversity across the globe.
Action to support the communities in which we work.  As a large player in the industry, we have a duty to contribute to the sustainable development of the communities in which we operate. In line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, our Social Commitment department is focused on combating poverty, protecting the environment, and promoting technological education in these regions, towards a better Planet and to ensure that communities are equipped with the skills they need for a digital future. Over the last three years, our 3000+ volunteers have supported more than three million people in 57 countries.
Circular Economy 
Circular Economy is a forward-looking concept, which means embracing an attitude of continuous review of how we consume materials and resources, how we design our products, how we adapt technology to prevent and minimize waste generation, and how we ensure the functionality of our products for longer time. By continuing to rethink processes and products through the lens of a circular economy we can deliver a better, more sustainable future.
For Siemens Gamesa, ‘it is all about integrating sustainability-thinking into all functions’. For example, one of wind energy’s greatest challenges is to make sure that the blades from the wind projects that are being decommissioned do not end in landfill. The opportunity therefore lies in finding ways to ensure these blades are either recycled or repurposed.
Dr. Nancy Bocken, Professor in Sustainable Business at Maastricht University, opens the debate: 'The most successful companies start with a circularity vision, how will they use products to make the world a better place?' 
Commitment to United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals
Delivering on the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26, and supporting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, requires all of us to act, and act now with urgency.   Without action, we face the alarming prospect of catastrophic climate change within this generation and continued social injustice.

Siemens Gamesa is part of the solution. We are driving the global green energy revolution and accelerating the efforts of our partners around the world. As a company, we are dedicated to driving the United Nations’ 2030 agenda and contributing to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets. To ensure the maximum impact, we prioritize the SDGs that are most relevant to us and focus our activities on SDG 7, 13, 5, 8 and 16.

Let’s act together, and turn climate commitments into climate justice for all.

When it comes to the climate crisis: Actions Speak Louder
  Actions speak louder than words. Delivering on the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26, and supporting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, requires all of us to act, and act now with urgency.   For Siemens Gamesa, protecting the planet for future generations is not just a job but a passion. Tackling climate change requires us to make dramatic changes, and to do this we need to act today, not tomorrow.
Sustainability
Embracing the circular economy and why it’s vital to a sustainable future
  “The circular economy” is a phrase that is being used a lot at the moment by governments, investors, manufacturers, distributors and commentators. It is a forward-looking concept, embracing an attitude which recognizes what can be achieved by adapting technology to minimize waste by-products and/or designing products that can be kept in circulation or repurposed.
Sustainability
U.S. blade recycling opportunities begin to overcome one of sector’s biggest challenges

Onshore wind provides foundations for green energy shift
Onshore wind energy today offers one of the most economical sources of electricity in most countries across the world and is a major factor in driving a new era in a global energy transition.

Siemens Gamesa is a pioneer in the development and expansion of onshore wind, contributing to the fight for a greener and more sustainable planet. The technology behind onshore turbines has developed rapidly in recent years, helping to dramatically lower the cost of producing wind energy. Siemens Gamesa will continue its commitment to ensuring that onshore wind reaches its full potential and has a positive impact on local communities.

Having established itself as a relevant and expanding source of green electricity, the onshore industry must now look beyond its boundaries. For Siemens Gamesa and the industry, this means exploring ways to extract the maximum potential for wind through energy storage in order to enhance the dependability of this energy source. New innovations such as developments in the production of hydrogen or storage facilities will not only boost the potential of onshore wind but will help us decarbonize heavy industry and transport sectors.

By the end of 2020, 743 GW of wind power was installed globally according to the Global Wind Energy Council, of which onshore wind accounted for 707 GW. According to independent forecasters, much more will be required for the world to meet its commitments to stop global temperatures rising above 1.5C. Annual average onshore installations are forecast at 79.8 GW over the next five years by GWEC, while around 180 GW of wind energy will need to be installed each year for the world to hit net zero.

Siemens Gamesa is determined to continue playing a crucial role in pushing onshore wind even further into the mainstream of energy sources in the coming decades by driving innovation and offering solutions adapted to each project to reduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LcoE), ensuring long-term returns for our customers.

Powerful performance at sea for more than 30 years
Over 30 years ago, we pioneered the offshore wind industry when in 1991 we installed the world’s first offshore wind power project, Vindeby in Denmark. Now, with a growing imperative to meet climate challenges as well as ensuring energy independence, we are more determined than ever to succeed in this challenge. Being global market leader in offshore wind turbines, we are fully committed to being part of the solution. Together with our partners, we aim to power the future of our industry.

The future for offshore wind power looks brighter than ever
The demand for global electricity is expected to increase steeply in the coming years. In the worldwide quest for more renewable energy sources, the rapid development of offshore wind power suggests this power source will be crucial to meet climate and energy targets as well as play a major part in our sector’s future. The exponential growth of offshore wind energy can be attributed to several factors, including abundant space and greater, consistent wind resources, as well as technological advantages for offshore wind turbines with high availability and capacity factors.
2022 saw approximately 9 GW of offshore wind capacity being installed, bringing the global operational offshore wind capacity to around 64 GW. China again led the way in terms of installation installing with more than 50% of installations in 2022. Outside China, the UK was the largest market followed by Taiwan both installing approximately 1.2GW. Overall, China has the largest installed base with around 30 GW, followed by the UK with approximately 14 GW, and Germany in third place with about 8 GW installed.
This growth in offshore wind is predicted to significantly accelerate over the coming years, with a global outlook of approximately 350 GW cumulatively installed by 2030. This growth outlook is solidified by +50 GW of new capacity expected to be allocated over the next two years.
Innovative new ventures such as green hydrogen and floating offshore wind will help to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and allow the expansion of new markets previously limited by geographical conditions, indicating a bright future ahead of offshore wind.

Our principle: Prevent – detect – respond
Under the 3 cornerstones of ""prevent – detect – respond"", we implemented unambiguous and binding principles of conduct. They ensure that Siemens Gamesa acts according to law as well as to internal policies set out in the Business Conduct Guidelines.
The motto stands for the following measures:
Prevent: Measures such as risk management, policies and procedures, training and communication make it possible to avoid systematic misconduct.
Detect: Compliance work requires complete transparency for early detection of issues. This is accomplished either via defined tools that assess whether the processes are correctly implemented and/or by whistleblowing channels such as the ‘Integrity Hotline’, as well as professional and fair investigations.
Respond: Explicit consequences and clear reactions to misconduct are important to prevent it from happening again in the future.
Because compliance is the basis of our business activity and the key to our integrity.

The Compliance organization of Siemens Gamesa
The Compliance organization has global governance and implementation responsibility within 3 areas: Compliance, Export Control and Customs (ECC), and Data Protection (DP).

Compliance
Only clean business is our business. Siemens Gamesa has zero tolerance for corruption, fraud, money laundering, and breaches of fair competition principles or other laws. This applies worldwide and at all levels of the organizations. In case of violations, we take swift action. Every employee is an important element in the program and is encouraged to contribute.

Data Protection
The collection, processing, usage, and storage of personal data is an integral part of our business. Thus, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy takes data protection seriously. We follow the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union.

Export Control and Customs
Siemens Gamesa uses and ships commodities and technologies that are classified as dual-use goods. In this regard, our business must always comply with export control laws. Our mission is to first secure the Export Control and Customs compliance and second reduce the cost of wind energy.
Siemens Gamesa Code of Conduct for suppliers and Third Party Intermediaries
At Siemens Gamesa, we require our suppliers and Third Party Intermediaries to consent to our Code of Conduct. This code is based on the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact. It covers legal compliance in general and our anticorruption policies in particular, including provisions against anticompetitive practices and conflicts of interest.

Whistleblowers Reporting Channels
Our Integrity Hotline is a whistleblower tool that offers the opportunity to report compliance violations in a secure manner, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in 13 languages, online or via telephone. Employees and management can use it, as can customers, suppliers and other stakeholders in case they have witnessed or learned about any irregular conduct.
We take data security very seriously: The reports can be sent anonymously, if desired. The system is managed by a third party supplier who ensures that messages and senders cannot be traced. All data supplied in a report is maintained on secure servers in Germany and the reported content is handled exclusively by Siemens Gamesa Compliance.
Moreover, we protect internal whistleblowers who report information to the best of their knowledge, with special regulations. However, intentional reporting of false information is prohibited by law in many countries.

Creating a sustainable working environment for all employees
We aim to be an employer of choice by pursuing improvements in people’s quality of life, and by empowering and motivating all employees with an exciting culture, life-long learning and development possibilities. Our employment model is based on respect for and compliance with universal human rights standards and progressive labor legislation. A good example of this can be found in the work-life balance measures designed and implemented by Siemens Gamesa. Notable among these are flexi-time schemes, continuous/shorter working day arrangements, vacation packages and the provision of end-to-end assistance to personnel posted abroad.
A global team
At the end of fiscal year 2019, the total headcount reached more than 24,500 full-time equivalent employees. Full-time equivalent employees are those with employment contracts based on employment hours compared to standard full-time employment hours.
From a regional perspective, Europe, the Middle East and Africa are the regions with the largest proportion of the workforce (67%), followed by Asia and Australia (20%) and the Americas (14%). The number of hiring’s in 2019 reached over 4,400. Europe, Middle East and Africa being the regions with most employees hired.
People working at Siemens Gamesa are mostly younger than 45 years. The age structure in 2019 shows that 37,39% of our workforce is under 35 years and 36,95% of the team between 35 and 45 years old. Another fifth is over 45 years old.
Diversity and equality
Close to 100 different nationalities are employed by Siemens Gamesa worldwide. Ours is a diverse workforce, and we value that deeply. Our company has a Diversity and Inclusion Policy that applies to all geographic regions where we are present. This policy aims to ensure equality and inclusion, and avoid any kind of discrimination based on race, gender, civil status, ideology, political opinions, nationality, religion or any other personal, physical or social characteristic.
Siemens Gamesa has a harassment protocol in place that stipulates how to prevent harassment in the workplace. The message is very clear. Any form of sexual, gender-based and/or psychological harassment is absolutely unacceptable. It offends dignity; it is harmful to the working environment and has undesirable effects on people’s health, morale, confidence and self-esteem. It has no place anywhere in our company.
With respect to gender diversity in the composition of the Board of Directors, Siemens Gamesa currently exceeds target of having the presence of at least 30 percent women by 2020. Our company has 3 women on the Board of Directors at 30 September 2019, which represents 23% of its members. The share of female employees represents an overall 19% of the total workforce.
Labor relations
Source: IndustriAll Union
Siemens Gamesa is firmly committed to pursuing labor relationships that are based on trust, transparency, and good faith negotiations. We believe in, and promote, workers’ rights to freedom of association, union membership and collective bargaining. The importance of this fundamental labor right is set out in the company’s Business Conduct Guidelines.
Labor relations between Siemens Gamesa and our employees are regulated by the legal regulations of each country and such pacts and agreements as may have been reached with workers’ representatives. Additionally, agreements that were in place prior to the company merger, such as the Global Framework Agreement signed by legacy Gamesa, the IndustriALL Global Union, CCOO de Industria, MCA-UGT and FITAGUGT on social, labor and environmental matters, are currently in force and represent the first global agreement to guarantee labor rights by a company in the renewable energy sector.

We also counted 615 graduates - including interns, apprentices and students.
Additionally, Siemens Gamesa has talent management tools that incorporate individual development plans for a number of high potential employees. Such plans are aimed at contributing to personal growth and developing desired competencies and skills. In addition to individual development plans, the company also has other programs for developing talent.

Our Suppliers Code of Conduct sets out rules to ensure that working conditions in the company’s supply chain are safe, that workers are treated decently and with respect and that all business transactions are ethically, socially and environmentally responsible. The Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, covers respect for human rights, particularly any right the violation of which would degrade employees, and rejects child labor and forced or compulsory labor.
Siemens Gamesa has a Whistleblowing Channel through which our employees can report activities that are unethical, lack integrity or go against the principles contained in the Code of Conduct. Compliance cases reported and confirmed during the reporting period amounted to 28. The number of disciplinary sanctions put in place during the period amounted to six.

Powering a net-zero future
Siemens Gamesa is deeply committed to generating a positive effect on the environment, providing clean solutions to power our homes, schools, hospitals and keeping us moving wherever we are – from the largest cities to the most remote corners of the planet. To this end, the company has outlined our way to contribute a decarbonized economy, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2040. This includes emissions produced by the company’s whole value chain. Previously, the net-zero target was 2050.
Our roadmap involves six emission reduction levers:
Energy reduction and efficiency measures
Electricity supply from renewable sources
Green mobility and fleet plan
Offseting projects for non-avoidable emissions
Employee awareness campaigns and idea management
Increased engagement across the value chain
Siemens Gamesa became carbon neutral in 2019 – five years ahead of schedule. In 2020, the company became powered by 100% renewable energy and had the SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative) verify that our emission reduction targets until 2025 are meeting the most ambitious 1.5°C scenario. To document our progress, we publish our Greenhouse Gas Emissions report annually which is externally verified according to the requirements described in ISO 14064-1:2018.
Together, our product portfolio and decarbonization strategy represents our biggest contributions to climate change mitigation according to SDG 13. Nevertheless, we work with multiple global communities who share our commitment to climate protection and decarbonization. For example, the Paris Pledge for Action, Caring for Climate and The Science Based Targets Initiative. We are also a CDP A-Lister.

Life cycle assessments
Siemens Gamesa calculates the environmental footprint of wind turbines using Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) – a method that assesses our product’s environmental impact over its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction and manufacturing, through transport, installation and operation, to decommissioning and recycling. We present the LCA results using Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs).
Our LCAs and EPDs are made in accordance with the ISO 14040, 14021 and 14025 series of standards and applicable Product Category Rules (PCRs). Many of these can be found in The International EPD® System (search for Siemens Gamesa).

Seeking alternative materials for high recyclability
Forging the future of wind
We are pursuing an ambitious target to reach net-zero CO2 emissions by 2040. The use of GreenerTowers alone will reduce total CO2 equivalent emissions from the turbine by an impressive 20%. This is the next important milestone on our journey to deliver even more sustainable wind energy.
Ensuring a sustainable production process with less environmental impact will be of great importance, given an expected rise in the number of installations and in the size of the turbines in coming years.

GreenerTower – The next step toward net-zero
Siemens Gamesa’s new GreenerTower focuses on achieving significant CO2 equivalent reductions in the steel plate production for steel towers. Today, the average CO2 equivalent emission on steel is 1.91 tons. For our GreenerTower, a maximum of 0.7t of CO2 equivalent emissions are permitted per ton of steel. This means a CO2 reduction on the tower  steel plates of at least 63% compared to conventional steel production.
The GreenerTower is based on the exact same design as a standard tower. The only difference is within the steel plate production, where CO2 emissions are significantly reduced compared to conventional steelmaking. GreenerTowers will initially be sold as an option for both Offshore and Onshore turbines for projects to be installed from 2024 and onwards.
There are several ways to achieve CO2 reduction in the production of steel, including the following:
Use of less energy intensive steel manufacturing processes.
Increased use of scrap steel.
Increased use of CO2 neutral energy sources.
The first milestone on the GreenerTower journey has already been achieved. By setting an ambitious threshold of 0.7 tons of CO2 equivalent emissions per ton of steel and ensuring third party certification, we significantly reduce the footprint of the largest component for a turbine in terms of CO2 equivalent emissions.
Pioneering turbine recyclability
While it is critical to hit net-zero targets and provide affordable, clean energy to the world, the rollout of clean energy must be done in a sustainable way, actively avoiding environmental damage and supporting the circular economy with a reduced reliance on resources.

The wind industry is still relatively young and is aware of the responsibility it holds of finding a sustainable way to deal with wind turbine components at the end of their life cycle. Increasing the recyclability of the wind components is high on our agenda, and we are committed to producing 100% recyclable turbines by 2040.
RecyclableBlade – Taking responsibility. Blade by blade
Previously, the industry has not been able to recycle wind turbine blades upon decommissioning, resulting in blades ending up as landfill. Now, thanks to our pioneering RecyclableBlade technology, the materials from our RecyclableBlade can be recycled and reused in other industries to the benefit of future generations.
The RecyclableBlade is the first product to offer a comprehensive recyclable solution and is ready for commercial use offshore. These wind turbine blades can now be transformed into other applications across various industries, providing streams of recycled materials for use in different manufacturing processes. A groundbreaking step towards creating a waste-free future for the wind industry.

Our RecyclableBlade is a simple, and robust solution, developed through technological ingenuity. The only change to the blade production process is our new resin. This means that scaling up production and rolling out this recyclable product is not only possible, it is already a reality! The first blades have already been produced in 2021.

Other projects
Siemens Gamesa backs WindEurope’s call for a Europe-wide ban on landfilling turbine blades by 2025. We also advocate for industry wide international standards on product decommissioning and recycling. We are a long-standing leader in numerous industry consortia and research projects to support the development of a circular economy. Some examples of these include DecomBlades, FiberEUse and GenVind.

We focus both on finding ways to demonstrate commercial value chains for thermoset rotor blades that are already installed in our fleet as well as investigating new materials with enhanced circularity for our future blades.
Enhancing biodiversity
Siemens Gamesa is aware of its interactions, and potential impact, on terrestrial and marine natural ecosystems, habitats, and species where its factories and turbine assets are.
There are various regulatory and voluntary instruments that ensure Siemens Gamesa’s wind projects are constructed and serviced in a way that allows for co-existence, and often a net-positive biodiversity impact. This is in line with SDG 14 and SDG 15, protecting life below water and on land, respectively.

The Siemens Gamesa Corporate Commitment to Biodiversity considers and integrates the main current biodiversity frameworks, initiatives and tendencies at an international level (Nature-Positive Global Goal for Nature). With this commitment, Siemens Gamesa ensures that its biodiversity management and performance will be at the forefront of the group of businesses and organizations that are establishing ambitions and commitments on the topic.

About us
Siemens Gamesa history
Our leadership team
Gamesa started its business more than 40 years ago. The company's focus was on emerging activities such as robotics, aeronautics, and composite materials.
Years 1976 - 1980
1976: Gamesa is incorporated under the name of Grupo Auxiliar Metalúrgico, working on the management of industrial projects and technology for emerging businesses.
1980: Bonus Energy (later to be acquired by Siemens AG) was founded in Denmark, when the irrigation system manufacturer Danregn diversified into the wind turbine business.
One of the first modern wind turbines developed by Bonus Energy with an output of 95 kW. Almost 40 years later, onshore wind turbines produce over 40 times more electricity.
Years 1981 - 1990
1981: Bonus Energy builds its first 22 kW, 10 m blade diameter turbine (that was still generating power in 2016!).
1982: Bonus Energy delivers its first turbines to the American market.
1986: Gamesa commences activities in the aerospace sector.
1990: Iberdrola invests in Gamesa.
  Vindeby was the world’s first offshore wind farm. The 11 Bonus 450 kW wind turbines were installed in 1991. After 25 years in operation the wind turbines were dismantled in 2017.
Years 1991 – 2000
1991: Bonus Energy builds the world's first offshore wind power plant at Vindeby, with a total capacity of 4.95 MW that can provide clean energy to around 2,000 households.
1993: Gamesa participates in the construction of a new aircraft for Embraer.
1994: Gamesa enters the wind energy sector.
1995: Gamesa installs its first wind farm in the hills of El Perdón in Spain.
1999: Installations by Gamesa reach the 1 GW mark.
  In 2002, we open our blade factory in Aalborg, Denmark. Later on, our engineers will manufacture the B75 blade here. With a length of 75 meters, it is the world's largest fiberglass component cast in one piece.
Years 2001 - 2003
2001: With projects in Portugal, France, Greece, Ireland, UK, US, China and Mexico, Gamesa’s shares are included in the Spanish blue-chip stock index, the Ibex 35.
2002: Gamesa acquires Echesa (gearboxes), Cantarey (generators), Enertrón (converters), Made and Navitas.
2002: Bonus Energy opens its Aalborg blade factory in Denmark, introducing a blade-technology called IntegralBlade®.
2003: Gamesa enters into new markets including Germany, Italy, India, Vietnam, Egypt, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Morocco.
With the acquisition of Bonus Energy, Siemens enters the wind energy industry. At that time, the company employs 750 people and is headquartered in Brande, Denmark.
Years 2004 - 2006
2004: Gamesa supplies its first order to India. Its first manufacturing facilities open in the US and China.
2004: Siemens acquires Bonus Energy A/S. At that time, Bonus Energy has an installed base of 3,321 MW in 20 countries with a market share of about 9%.
2006: Gamesa disposes of its aerospace division to focus on the renewable energy business.
  To meet the constantly growing energy demand and take account of climate change, our industry is growing and wind energy is becoming a competitive energy source.
Years 2007 - 2010
2007: An alliance is struck between Gamesa and the Daniel Alonso group for the manufacture of turbine towers.
2007: Siemens Wind Power celebrates the opening of a new wind turbine blade factory in Fort Madison, Iowa.

Years 2017 - 2022
2017: Siemens Wind Power and Gamesa concluded the merger of their wind power businesses, combining their unique product portfolios for wind power onshore, offshore and services. After the registration of Siemens Gamesa in the Mercantile Registry of Biscay, in Spain, the merger of Gamesa and Siemens Wind Power becomes effective and a new, united company is borned. 
2018: Siemens Gamesa confirmed its largest-to-date offshore order via Danish energy group Ørsted, providing 165 of its SG 8.0-167 DD wind turbines to the Hornsea Project.
2019: Siemens Gamesa became the world’s first wind turbine manufacturer to receive an investment grade rating, and installed a new annual record of 1.2 GW of turbines for the decade.
2020: Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 epidemic, Siemens Gamesa launched the SG 14-222 DD, an unprecedented offshore wind turbine with a record order intake.

2021: The first offshore wind turbine OEM blade facility in the United States was planned in Virginia, focusing on the SG 14-222 DD machines.

2022: Siemens Gamesa became the #1 installer of offshore wind projects, and introduced the world’s first Recyclable Blade ready for the market.
2023: The future of Siemens Gamesa
In May 2022, Siemens Energy announced the tender offer to acquire all remaining shares of Siemens Gamesa. This concluded in December 2022, and after a standing purchase order in place until 7 February 2023 Siemens Energy held around 98% of Siemens Games shares. On February 14, 2023 the Siemens Gamesa shares were delisted from the Spanish Stock Exchanges. On June 13, 2023, the minority shareholders of Siemens Gamesa approved a capital reduction for the remaining 2.21% of its shares. This has paved the way for a full integration of Siemens Energy with Siemens Gamesa, and signals their shared future, and Siemens Energy AG became the sole shareholder of Siemens Gamesa.
