Footnote link 2
checking account.
Definitions:
“Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account” means an HSBC Premier Relationship Savings account open as of February 28, 2025, that is held by the customer as either the sole account owner or, for joint accounts, as the first named account owner.
“New Deposits” means money not previously held in a deposit account at HSBC Bank USA, N.A. Whether money was previously held at HSBC is determined at HSBC’s discretion. New Deposits must be added to the Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account no later than March 31, 2025, to be counted towards this offer.
“Premier Relationship Savings Balance Increase” means the net increase in the customer’s Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account balance from December 31, 2024, to March 31, 2025. New Deposits made across multiple Eligible Premier Relationship Savings accounts will NOT be aggregated. If a customer owns multiple accounts, the Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account with the highest total increase in New Deposits will be used to determine the Premier Relationship Savings Balance Increase.
“Total Deposit Balance” means the total balances in the Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account, and any other checking, savings and Certificate of Deposit accounts owned by any of the customer(s) named on the Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account.
“Baseline Deposit Balance” means the Total Deposit Balance as of December 31, 2024. For new customers with HSBC accounts opened after December 31, 2024, the Baseline Deposit Balance is $0.
“Total Deposit Balance Increase” means the net increase in the Total Deposit Balance from December 31, 2024 (Baseline Deposit Balance) to March 31, 2025.
Terms to Qualify for Cash Bonus:
Customer must meet each of the following requirements to qualify for the Cash Bonus:
Have an open Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account as of February 28, 2025, linked to an open HSBC Premier checking account.
Add New Deposits of $100,000 or more into the Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account by March 31, 2025. New Deposits must result in:
Premier Relationship Savings Balance Increase of $100,000 or more from December 31, 2024, to March 31, 2025
Total Deposit Balance Increase of $100,000 or more from December 31, 2024, (Baseline Deposit Balance) to March 31, 2025.
Maintain the Premier Relationship Savings Balance Increase of $100,000 or more AND Total Deposit Balance Increase of $100,000 or more through June 30, 2025.
The Cash Bonus amount is tiered and determined by the customer meeting and maintaining the required balance increase in both the Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account AND across total deposit accounts:
Balance Increase : Cash Bonus
$100,000-$249,999.99: $1,000
$250,000-$499,999.99: $2,000
$500,000+: $3,000
Deposit account balances will be reviewed periodically from March 31, 2025, through June 30, 2025, to confirm the customer has met and maintained the required Premier Relationship Savings Balance Increase and Total Deposit Balance Increase. If the balance increase in either the customer’s Premier Relationship Savings account or across total deposit accounts varies between March 31, 2025, and June 30, 2025, the lowest of the Premier Relationship Savings Balance Increase and Total Deposit Balance Increase during that period will determine the customer’s Cash Bonus tier.
Each customer is eligible for no more than one Cash Bonus. For joint accounts, the first name on the joint account is considered the customer for the Cash Bonus.
If all offer requirements are met, the Cash Bonus will be deposited into the Eligible Premier Relationship Savings account by August 29, 2025. Any payments may be subject to tax and will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service as required by applicable law.

When you're ready to make a transaction, you'll have the choice of sending to your own HSBC account or to someone else's HSBC account. 
Your maximum daily limit is:
USD200,000 to your own HSBC accounts
USD50,000 to any other HSBC accounts
You'll be able to chose which currency you want to use, and you'll see the exchange rate (if you've chosen to send in a foreign currency). The exchange rate you'll get is live during trading market opening hours. When markets are closed, it's based on the most up-to-date market rate.
The HSBC Digital Security Device is integrated with the app and uses two-factor authentication to provide an added layer of protection.

What you need to know to get your financial house in order
Moving to a new country can be one of the most exciting events in life.
The joys of experiencing a new culture, cuisine, and set of customs; the new cities; the countryside; and, perhaps, even a language to explore – as Saint Augustine famously said, “The world is a book and those who do not travel read only a page.”
In addition to the joy, however, moving entails its share of stress: visas, housing, employment, schools for the kids. And, in order to make everything else work, the need to master a new financial system.
Fortunately, you’re in luck: we’ve prepared this quick guide of the most important things to know when moving to the U.S., zeroing in on those pesky finances. Read on.
It’s a big country; choose wisely
In a country as big as the United States, the cost of living across regions and states can vary as widely as the geography, climate, and culture. To top that off, state and local laws can differ more, state-to-state and county-to-county, than in countries with more centralized legal systems. In short, New York is not Nebraska and San Francisco sure ain’t San Antonio.
Get it all started with a bank account
As in American supermarkets, where rows and rows of breakfast cereals await you, there is also a bewildering choice of banking options. These range from commercial banks, which have the benefit of convenience and multiple branches, to credit unions, which may offer more personalized customer service, to investment companies which, in exchange for higher fees, will help you manage everything from basic checking to sophisticated investments. Each of these offers its own slate of accounts with differing requirements, so it pays to shop around. And if you already bank at an institution that has a U.S. presence, you may be able to open an international account before you even get to your new home!
Start building up credit
One of the most difficult things about moving from abroad is the lack of a credit history, without which anything from a car loan to a mortgage may be out of reach without a co-signer. A strong credit history could help improve many aspects of your life in the U.S. In fact, having some history of debt management is better than having none. It may seem counterintuitive, but companies and individuals will often want to see evidence that you can manage money responsibly before they enter into a contract with you. This means that potential employers, landlords, utility providers and insurance companies may ask to see your credit score and, occasionally, your full credit report. So, even if you have no need or plans to borrow money, it’s still a good idea to try to build and carefully manage your credit score. You can do this by applying for and using a credit card regularly. To build positive credit and ensure you’re not in debt, make sure that you never spend more than you’re able to pay back, pay your credit card bill on time each month, and maintain plenty of room between your balance and credit limit.
Be aware of tax issues
As a “non-resident alien,” you will have to pay tax on income earned in the U.S. Once you qualify for “resident alien” status, however, your income will be taxed like an American citizen. Which means – and this comes as a surprise for many – that your worldwide income is subject to tax, not just what you earn in the U.S. Check to see if your country has a tax treaty with the United States, which may entitle you to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax in areas such as pensions, interest, dividends, royalties, and capital gains. Also, a financial advisor can help you determine how best to set up your investments before moving to avoid being unnecessarily clipped by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Have pension, will travel
Although you will have to pay into the American Social Security for at least ten years before qualifying for retirement benefits, here’s the good news: you may be able to transfer your own pension plan with you. UK residents, for example, can transfer their pension to a qualifying US plan through the Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme. It’s worth seeing what arrangements your home country has in place.
With some careful pre-trip planning in these areas, you can spend less time worrying upon your arrival and more time enjoying all that America has to offer, from its cities to its national parks, sports, film, and a vibrant multi-racial, multi-ethnic culture. Welcome!

In broad terms, “ESG and sustainable investing” products include investment approaches or instruments which consider environmental, social, governance and/or other sustainability factors to varying degrees. There is no guarantee that ESG and Sustainable investing products will produce returns similar to those which don’t consider these factors. ESG and Sustainable investing products may diverge from traditional market benchmarks. In addition, at this time in the United States there is no standard definition of, or measurement criteria for, ESG and Sustainable investing or the impact of ESG and Sustainable investing products. ESG and Sustainable investing and related impact measurement criteria are (a) highly subjective and (b) may vary significantly across and within sectors. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc., and HSBC Bank USA N.A. (collectively “HSBC”) may rely on non-HSBC ESG measurement or scoring criteria originating, devised and/or reported by unaffiliated third parties or issuers. HSBC does not always conduct its own specific due diligence in relation to these unaffiliated parties’ own ESG measurement or scoring criteria. There is no guarantee: (a) that the nature of the ESG / sustainability impact or measurement criteria of an investment will be aligned with any particular investor’s sustainability goals; or (b) that the stated level or target level of ESG / sustainability impact will be achieved. ESG and Sustainable investing is an evolving area and new regulations are being developed which will affect how such investments can be recommended, categorized, or labelled. An investment which is considered to fulfil sustainable criteria today may not meet those criteria at some point in the future.
ESG/Sustainable investing may impact exposure to issuers, sectors, and industries, limiting the type and number of investment opportunities available, which may impact performance. An ESG portfolio may or may not financially outperform similar investments that do not consider ESG criteria. To the extent that a product reflects an ESG or Sustainable label in its security title or name, the product may not be considered by HSBC to be an ESG or Sustainable investment and will not be recommended as an ESG or sustainable investment.
HSBC does not provide any ESG recommendations or advice as part of our brokerage services offering. ESG recommendations/advice are limited to managed account offerings available in the Spectrum II ESG model. Additionally, we reserve the right to not recommend, or trade securities based on HSBC Group’s* internal policies, including its sustainability policies. Customers can purchase ESG/SI related products on our platform on a self-directed basis. Any ESG/SI macroeconomic statements or promotional materials generated by other HSBC Group entities may not reflect the views of HSBC.

Additional information
Fixed income products are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity and market risks, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors to varying degrees.
Investors should be aware that the fund's yield and the value of its portfolio fluctuate and can be affected by changes in interest rates, general market conditions and other political, social and economic developments. However, investors in any bond fund should anticipate fluctuations in price, especially for longer-term issues and in environments of rising interest rates. Investments in bond funds are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of the underlying securities and their inability to meet their current obligations. These risks may increase the fund's share price volatility.
US Treasuries are guaranteed as to the payment of principal and interest by the US Government.
Fixed Income products are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity and market risks. Income from municipal securities may be subject to state and local taxes as well as the Alternative Minimum Tax. Call features may exist that can impact yield. If sold prior to maturity, investments in municipal securities are subject to gains/losses based on the level of interest rates, market conditions and credit quality of the issuer. Additional information about individual municipal securities, including municipal disclosure documents, and about market activity may be available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's Electronic Municipal Market Access information site, www.emma.msrb.org. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. does not provide tax, legal or accounting advice. Please contact your tax advisor regarding the suitability of tax-exempt investments in your portfolio and your accounting advisor to determine the appropriate accounting treatment. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks and charges and expenses associated with municipal fund securities before investing. Further information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer’s official statement. The official statement should be read carefully before investing.
Investments subject to the credit risk of the issuer are generally the obligations of the issuer and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the investments with credit risk, including any return of principal or coupon payable at maturity, if applicable, depends on the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result, the actual and perceived credit worthiness of an issuer may affect the market value of an investment with such credit risk and, in the event an issuer were to default on its obligations, you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the investment.
Foreign securities carry special risks, such as exposure to currency fluctuations, less developed or less efficient trading markets, political instability, a lack of company information, differing auditing and legal standards, volatility and, potentially, less liquidity. International investing including emerging markets involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility that is heightened when investing in emerging markets. Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. Economies in Emerging Markets generally are heavily dependent upon international trade and, accordingly, have been and may continue to be affected adversely by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These economies also have been and may continue to be affected adversely by economic conditions in the countries in which they trade.
Brokered Certificates of Deposit are offered by Registered Representatives of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC, Brokered CD Products are: Bank deposits; obligations of the issuing bank; FDIC insured within applicable limits; not a liquid investment; and are designed to be held to maturity. Brokered CDs are subject to investment risk and any early repayment could result in a loss of principal investment.
All GSE debt is not guaranteed by the federal government, whereas government agencies such as Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) are divisions of the government whose securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

Popular investment strategies
Asset allocation
A disciplined approach to long-term investing, designed to seek consistent exposure to markets. This approach does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns. However, it may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns.
Dollar cost averaging
A strategy in which securities, typically mutual funds, are purchased in fixed dollar amounts at regular intervals, regardless of what direction the market is moving. While this method doesn't guarantee against losses, over time, this can help to reduce the average cost of acquired shares.
Target date (""life cycle"") investing
Investors choose a fund with a specified target date near a personal need or goal (such as retirement) for which they will need to access their invested funds. Though target date investing does not protect against loss of principal, the fund's risk exposure is gradually reduced as a target date draws nearer to prepare for the approaching liquidity needs.
Things to know

While there isn't any eligibility to apply, there are risks associated with investing and you may experience losses or returns.

What are equities and ETFs?
Equities1
Footnote link 1
represent ownership stakes in corporations. Typical equities may include common stock, preferred stock, foreign equities and closed-end funds.
An ETF2
Footnote link 2
- or exchange traded fund - is a collection of securities, such as equities, bonds or options, that are bought and sold in real-time like a stock on a stock exchange. Most ETFs are not actively managed, but instead are designed to track an index. In general, the expense ratios of ETFs are relatively low. Like equities, an ETF’s price may fluctuate intraday based on demand.
Both equities and ETFs can offer potential growth from market price appreciation. However, they are subject to market volatility and therefore open to market price risk and potential loss of principal.

Additional information
Equity securities include common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities and mutual funds that invest in these securities. Equity markets can be volatile. Stock prices rise and fall based on changes in an individual company's financial condition and overall market conditions. Stock prices can decline significantly in response to adverse market conditions, company-specific events, and other domestic and international political and economic developments.
Exchange-traded funds are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility such that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF but must be bought and sold on an exchange like an individual equity or bond.
  ETFs are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully along with your specific best interest considerations before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Wealth Relationship Manager or call 888-525-5757 or for International clients call collect 847.876.1574. Read it carefully before you invest.

Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Customer Disclosure
At this time in the United States, there is no standard definition of, or measurement criteria for, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors or impact.  ESG-related measurement criteria is highly subjective and may vary significantly across and within different sectors.  There is no guarantee that: (a) the nature of the ESG investment, or the ESG impact or measurement criteria of an investment, will be aligned with any particular investor’s ESG goals; (b) the stated or targeted ESG level will be achieved; or (c) an investment approach that considers ESG factors will produce returns similar to those that don’t, or that they won’t diverge from traditional market benchmarks.
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc. (collectively “HSBC”) may rely on metrics or measurement criteria devised and/or reported by third party providers or issuers.  HSBC does not always conduct its own specific due diligence in relation to ESG metrics or measurement criteria.
ESG investing is an evolving area and new regulations may come into effect which may affect how an investment is categorized or labeled. An investment that is considered to fulfil ESG criteria today may not meet those criteria at some point in the future.
Please consider the investment’s specific ESG impact measurement criteria in the prospectus or other offering documents prior to investing.

Your customer relationship summary
HSBC Securities and our Wealth Relationship Managers are here to assist you in assessing your financial needs and help you find the investment solutions that align with these needs.
Home  Investments  Customer Relationship Summary
Regulation Best Interest enhances the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond existing suitability obligations, and aligns the standard of conduct with retail customers’ reasonable expectations by requiring broker-dealers, among other things, to: 
Act in the best interest of the retail customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial and/or other interest of the broker-dealer ahead of the interests of the retail customer; and
Address conflicts of interest by establishing, maintaining, and enforcing policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and fully and fairly disclose material facts about conflicts of interest, and in instances where we have determined that disclosure is insufficient to reasonably address the conflict, to mitigate or, in certain instances, eliminate the conflict.
One of the ways that your Wealth Relationship Manager fulfills their duty to disclose services and offerings of the firm as well as associated conflicts is to provide you with a Customer Relationship Summary, ‘Form CRS’, which allows you to make a fully informed decision regarding investment recommendations.
Our Customer Relationship Summary, ‘Form CRS’, along with our HSBC Brokerage Brochure, can assist in providing detail on our services offered, as well as provide you information on potential associated charges for HSBC Securities’ products and services.
It is our goal to make sure you are fully informed of the charges incurred for HSBC Securities services.

United States persons (including U.S. citizens and residents) are subject to U.S. taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their U.S. and non-U.S. accounts including, for example, Form TD F 90-22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (""FBAR"")). U.S. persons should consult a tax adviser for more information.
1 Asset allocation is a method of diversification that positions assets among major investment categories. This tool may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns. However, it does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns.
2 Fixed income products are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity and market risks, to varying degrees.
3 Investments in variable products will fluctuate and values upon redemption may be less than the original amount invested. Variable annuities are designed to be long-term investments and frequently involve substantial charges such as administrative fees, annual contract fees, mortality & risk expense charges and surrender charges. All decisions regarding the tax implications of your investment(s) should be made in connection with your independent tax advisor. When investing in tax-deferred annuities additional risks apply and such products may not be suitable for or in the best interest of all investors. Early withdrawals may impact annuity cash values and death benefits. Early surrender charges may also apply. An additional 10% IRS penalty may apply to withdrawals prior to age 59 ½. If you are investing in a variable annuity through a tax-advantaged retirement plan such as an IRA, you will receive no additional tax advantage from a variable annuity. Under these circumstances, you should only consider buying a variable annuity if it makes sense because of the annuity's other features, such as lifetime income payments and death benefit protection. Features that provide lifetime income are optional and can be purchased at an additional cost. For more complete information, contact your Wealth Relationship Manager to obtain a current prospectus. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
4 To qualify for an HSBC Premier relationship, you need to open an HSBC Premier checking account and meet one of the following requirements. A monthly maintenance fee5 of $50 will be incurred if at least one of these requirements is not maintained. Refer to your ‘HSBC Premier Terms and Charges Disclosure
HSBC Premier Terms and Charges Disclosure This link will open in a new window
’ for full details.
Balances of $100,000 in combined U.S. consumer and qualifying commercial U.S. Dollar deposit and investment6 accounts; OR
Monthly recurring direct deposits7 totaling at least $5,000 from a third party to an HSBC Premier checking account(s); OR
Any HSBC U.S. residential mortgage loan serviced by HSBC. Home Equity products, loans that are in foreclosure or bankruptcy, and loans for which servicing rights have been transferred are not included
Consumers who maintain Private Bank status8
5 You will not be charged a Monthly Maintenance Fee for the calendar month in which you open your account and the following 3 calendar months (together, the “Waiver Period”), whether you meet the qualifying criteria or not. If immediately after the “Waiver Period”, you have not met one of the HSBC Premier qualification criteria and your HSBC Premier checking account is charged 3 consecutive Monthly Maintenance Fees, your account will be closed. In addition, any other checking, savings, credit card and Global Money Accounts that you own will be closed, unless you (or a joint account holder on those accounts) hold a different HSBC Premier checking account.
6 Investment and annuity products are offered by HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (HSBC Securities), member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC. HSBC Securities is an affiliate of HSBC Bank USA, N.A.
7 Qualifying direct deposits are electronic deposits of regular periodic payments (such as salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income) deposited through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network to this account by your employer or an outside agency (please check with your employer or outside agency to determine if they use the ACH network). Direct deposits that do not qualify include but are not limited to transfers from one account to another, mobile deposits, or deposits made at a Wealth Center or ATM

Managed Accounts
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is the sponsor of the HSBC Spectrum program. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is a registered investment adviser that serves as the Investment Adviser for the HSBC Spectrum program. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. provides administrative and other services to HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. in relation to the Spectrum Program. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. and certain other sub-advisers receive a fee for their mutual fund investment services separate from the investment management fee charged for the Spectrum program. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. also serves as the adviser and administrator of the HSBC Funds, which may be among the underlying investments in the Spectrum program. Certain HSBC Funds also have sub-advisers, not always affiliated with HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc., that receive fees for providing various services to the funds. Mutual funds outside of the HSBC Fund family are also offered as options in the Spectrum program and may be advised by investment managers affiliated or unaffiliated with HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., who also receive a fee for their investment services. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the Adviser. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA and SIPC is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds.
529 Plans
Tax treatment of 529 Plans varies from state to state and can be a major factor in deciding which plan to select. Broker-sold plans often contain sales loads and higher fees and expenses than direct-sold plans.  If your state offers a 529 plan you may want to consider what, if any, potential state income tax or other benefits it offers, before investing.  State tax or other benefits should be one of many factors to be considered prior to making an investment decision.  The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Financial Advisor.  Read it carefully before you invest.  For tax advice, consult your tax professional.
Structured Products:
Structured Certificates of Deposit are provided by Registered Representatives of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC.  Structured CD Products are:  Bank deposits; obligations of the issuing bank; FDIC insured within applicable limits; not a liquid investment; and are designed to be held to maturity.  Structured CDs are subject to investment risk and any early repayment could result in a loss of principal investment.
Structured Notes are provided by Registered Representatives of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE/FINRA/SIPC, a registered Futures Commission Merchant, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. and an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc. Investing in Structured Notes may result in a loss.  The return on the notes is linked to the performance of the underlying asset, which may be negative, and involves risks specific to the relevant underlying asset.  Structured notes are not a liquid investment and are designed to be held to maturity.
Registered Notes may be suitable for or in the best interest of investors who are willing to forego dividends or other distributions paid to holders of stocks comprising the relevant Reference Asset, or the Reference Asset itself, as applicable, do not seek current income from their investment, do not seek an investment for which there is an active secondary market, are willing to hold the securities to maturity and are comfortable with the creditworthiness of HSBC, as issuer of the securities.
Fixed Annuity:
Fixed annuities are designed to be long-term investments.  All decisions regarding the tax implications of your investment(s) should be made in connection with your independent tax advisor. When investing in tax-deferred annuities additional risks apply and such products may not be suitable for or in the best interest of all investors. Early withdrawals may impact annuity cash values and death benefits. Early surrender charges may also apply. An additional 10% IRS penalty may apply to withdrawals prior to age 59 ½. If you are investing in a fixed annuity through a tax-advantaged retirement plan such as an IRA, you will receive no additional tax advantage from a fixed annuity. Under these circumstances, you should only consider buying a fixed annuity if it makes sense because of the annuity's other features, such as lifetime income payments and death benefit protection.  Guarantees of a fixed rate of return are based on the claims paying ability of the issuing insurer.

I. A total of $500 or more in purchases or payments made through your HSBC debit card(s) and posted to a linked Premier checking account during the previous calendar month. Debit card ATM withdrawals do not qualify as eligible transactions. Transaction posting dates will be used to determine qualification in any given month, which may in some instances differ from actual purchase dates.
II. A total of $500 or more in payments from your linked Premier checking account to your HSBC credit card(s). Qualifying payment methods include ACH payments, Online Banking, telephone payments, Auto pay / EZ pay, and payments made in a Wealth Center.

III. A total of $5,000 or more in qualifying direct deposits from a third party to the linked Premier checking account during the previous calendar month. Qualifying direct deposits are electronic deposits of regular periodic payments (such as salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income) deposited through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network to this account by your employer or an outside agency (please check with your employer or outside agency to determine if they use the ACH network).

Accounts that do not qualify will receive the Standard APY for the entire following month. If there are changes to your linked Premier checking account (it is closed, changed to a new account type or no longer linked to your Premier Relationship Savings account), you may no longer qualify for the Relationship APY.
Accounts opened on or after October 1, 2024, that are linked to an eligible Premier checking account will automatically receive the Relationship APY for the remainder of the month of account opening and the following three full calendar months (Introductory Period). To continue earning the Relationship APY, one of the five qualification criteria must be met during the last month of the Introductory Period and each following month. Refer to the ‘HSBC Premier Relationship Savings Terms and Charges Disclosure’ for full details.
Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) are variable and subject to change after opening. Charges and fees may reduce earnings. Account is not available to business customers.

Additional information
Cardmembers who wish to participate in the HSBC Rewards for Miles Program (“Rewards for Miles”) must first become a member of a participating travel rewards program and obtain a number for each travel rewards program for which they would like to redeem Points for travel reward program miles. Only HSBC Premier World Mastercard® and HSBC Elite World Elite Mastercard Cardmembers ‘Cardmembers’ whose accounts are valid and in good standing are eligible to participate in Rewards for Miles and to transfer Points to a participating travel rewards program. Timing for the redeemed Points to be converted to miles and post to the Cardmember travel reward program account may take up to 14 days. The conversion rate of Points may vary by travel reward program. Once Points are transferred to travel reward program, they will be immediately deducted from your available Points balance; points cannot be canceled or transferred back to the HSBC Rewards Account or re-transferred to another participating travel reward program account. Once HSBC rewards points are successfully transferred to a travel rewards partner of your choice, HSBC will not be responsible for any disputes between your selected travel rewards partner and you.

Customers with a physical US address on their HSBC Credit Card and Amazon account can redeem Points through Amazon Shop with Points. Terms and conditions applicable to redeeming your HSBC Rewards Points through Amazon Shop with Points can be found at www.amazon.com/hsbcrewards.
Customers can choose to receive cash back redemptions as a direct deposit into their HSBC Bank USA, N.A. Checking or Savings Account, or as a statement credit on their HSBC Credit Card. For complete eligibility details, refer to your HSBC Guide to Benefits.
Premier:
To offset a purchase by redeeming for a statement credit through Mastercard Pay with Rewards™, the purchase must appear on your transaction history within the last 90 days on the Pay with Rewards page of the HSBC Rewards site. You may redeem Points for the full amount of your eligible purchase for purchases greater than $25. The statement credit will be applied to your HSBC Premier World Mastercard® Account. You may redeem Points for the full amount of your eligible purchase. Point redemptions are reflected as soon as the next business day in your HSBC Rewards Account and, on a monthly basis, as credits on your monthly credit card statement. There is no annual or lifetime maximum on the amount of statement credits that can be applied to your Account. Any request for statement credit redemption is final and cannot be revoked.
Note: An “ineligible purchase” means cash advances, interest and financing charges, fees, credit or debit adjustments and any amount other than purchases that may be charged to your Account with your card or checks. There must be sufficient points available in the HSBC Rewards account at the time of purchase authorization for a purchase to be eligible for Pay with Rewards. We may establish other qualifying and non-qualifying transactions from time to time. Point redemptions through Pay with Rewards do not count towards your monthly minimum payment on your HSBC Premier World Mastercard® Account.

The statement credit will be applied to your HSBC Elite World Elite Mastercard® Account. You may redeem Points for the full amount of your eligible purchase for purchases greater than $25. Each point you redeem through Pay with Rewards for purchases in eligible Travel categories is worth $0.0125, which means that 100 points is worth $1.25 in redemption value compared to the cash redemption value of $1. For example, 20,000 points are worth $250 towards travel, or $200 when redeemed for cash. Point redemptions are reflected as soon as the next business day in your HSBC Rewards Account and, on a monthly basis, as credits on your monthly credit card statement. There is no annual or lifetime maximum on the amount of statement credits that can be applied to your Account. Any request for statement credit redemption is final and cannot be revoked.

Home  FAQ | Customer Service  Routing Number
What is my HSBC routing number?
HSBC's ACH routing number is 022000020.
A bank routing number is a nine-digit number, also called an ABA routing number or routing transit number, and is used by US financial institutions to send and receive electronic transactions between banks. Use our 022000020 Automated Clearing House (ACH) routing number for transactions such as:
Direct deposit of your paycheck from your employer directly into your HSBC account
Recurring transfers or payments from your HSBC account to pay monthly bills like utilities, tuition or cable
Pay friends and family through popular online payment apps
  Common Questions
  Why does this routing number look different than the one on my paper checks?
We use a lot of different routing numbers because we have Wealth Centers all across the country and our routing numbers correspond to the Wealth Center location. This universal routing number is designed to make it easier for everyone to use and reference.
  Can I use the universal routing number for wire transfers?
Unfortunately, no. For information on sending and receiving an international or domestic wire transfer with your HSBC account click here.
  Where can I find my HSBC account number?
You can find your account number in Personal Internet Banking, on your statements, or at the bottom of your checks.
  How do I set up direct deposit into my HSBC account?
Complete and sign the Direct Deposit Authorization Form
Direct Deposit Authorization Form This link will open in a new window
, and along with a voided check, give it to the party making the direct deposit into your account.

HSBC History in the USA
Our presence in the USA dates back to 1875 when HSBC opened an office in San Francisco, and five years later, an office in New York City. Both locations specialized in trade finance. In 1955, the San Francisco office was converted to The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation of California, a new subsidiary that developed a small network of branches with a continued focus on trade.
In 1980, HSBC acquired a majority stake in Marine Midland Bank, with a full takeover completed seven years later. Marine Midland Bank was renamed HSBC Bank USA in 1999. In that same year, HSBC Holdings plc made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange and completed the acquisition of Republic New York Corporation.
In 2024, HSBC moved its corporate U.S. headquarters to The Spiral in New York City, the financial capital of the world, reaffirming our commitment to our clients.
